A man walks into a bar, with a huge alligator on a 
leash. He walks over to the bar, and orders a beer. 
The bartender says "Sorry sir. You can't bring that 
alligator in here! It's a dangerous animal, and you're 
scaring all of the patrons! 

True enough, the man looked around, and noticed 
that everyone was standing on the tables, looking 
very nervous. "But wait!" he cried, "this alligator is 
tame! It wouldn't hurt anyone!". However, the 
bartender is adamant. "If", the man continues, "I can 
prove that this alligator is not vicious, can he stay?". 
"Well, I guess so", says the bartender, "however, 
you're going to have a devil of a time proving to 
everyone in here that that alligator is tame!" The man 
smiles, and leans over the alligator. 

"Ralph!", he shouts, "Sit up!" With that, he beats 
the alligator on the head with his fist "BANG BANG 
BANG". And the alligator rears up on its tail. 
"Ralph, open your mouth! BANG BANG BANG". 
And the alligator opened it's huge mouth wide, 
revealing row upon row of gleaming white teeth. 
The man pulls out his wang, and lays it in the 
alligators mouth, as the entire bar crowd gasps. 
"Ralph! Close your mouth, but DON'T BITE! BANG 
BANG BANG". As the man pummels the alligator 
on the head, the giant mouth slowley closes, and 
stops juuuussttt short of biting the guys dick off. 

The crowd sighs, and the man says "Ralph, open 
your mouth! BANG BANG BANG!" and the 
alligators mouth opens wide again. "There,"says the 
man to the crowd, " now would anyone else like to 
try this?" 

A blonde in the back says "Yeah, I'll try, but only if 
your promise not to hit me on the head so hard".

         2. One, but he leaves the old bulb in the parking lot of the
            Walden Galleria.
            Note: The Walden Galleria Mall, only an hour and a half away
            from the Centre of the Universe and just off the Interstate
            in Buffalo, New York, was the Mecca of Torontonians engaging
            in the old Canadian tradition of cross border shopping. On a
            weekend the parking lot would be so full of Ontario plates
            you would think that you were in Canada. Of course you could
            not legally return to Canada with more than $25 worth of
            goods for an afternoon visit and so thousands of honest,
            polite and industrious Canadians were turned into lowlife
            smugglers. The classic method for smuggling clothing was
            "wearing it back" and so long lines of cars containing
            scantily and poorly dressed Canadians would patiently queue
            up Sunday morning to cross into New York State and a few
            hours later, miraculously, in the true American tradition of
            rags to riches, be transformed into trendy and well attired
            Torontonians as they returned home satiated by an intensive
            afternoon of power shopping with nothing to declare to Canada
            Customs, leaving their rags behind to grace the dumpsters of
            the exotic malls of Williamsburg and Cheektawoga. This all
            ended with the introduction of Sunday shopping in Ontario in
            1992 and the steadily declining value of the Canadian dollar.
            Sorry I got so long winded, but Sunday in Buffalo was fun
            while it lasted, even if you got caught and this joke, lame
            as it is, brought back a lot of memories.

          stage of the bier brewing process adheres to the Reinheitsgebot
          ancient brewing laws laid down in 1516 which set minimum
          standards for the purity of the ingredients otherwise they'd be
          subject to extremely enormous fines so quality control is a
          very important job both in terms of the quality of all the
          Lowenbrau biers and of course the financial good health of the
          company from the checking of the malted barley with the hops

            getting brighter !!!

            sit in the dark.

         3. One, but if he changes it, the whole building will probably
            fall down.
         4. Two. One always leaves in the middle of the project.
         5. Four. One to design the change, one to implement it, one to
            document it, and one to maintain it afterwards.
         6. Four, plus one senior analyst to manage the project, one
            technical writer to correct the spelling and grammar of the
            one who documented it, one light bulb librarian, a
            sales-force of at least five to drum up enough users who want
            to turn the light on, 274 users to burn out the new bulb, at

            in, and two to explain why the project was late.
         8. Wait! Maybe the bulb isn't broken. Let's try it again.
         9. It's hard to say. Each time we separate the bulb into its

        10. The change is 90 percent complete.
        11. We looked at the light fixture and decided there's no point
            trying to maintain it. We're going to rewrite it from
            scratch. Could you wait two months?
        12. Only one, but she's not available. She's the only programmer
            we have who can get the <insert name here> software ready to
            ship to customers, and that's higher priority, you know.
        13. Of course, as everyone knows, just five years ago all it took

   How many C++ programmers does it take to change a light bulb?
          
         1. You're still thinking procedurally. A properly designed light
            bulb object would inherit a change method from a generic
            light bulb class, so all you'd have to do is send a light
            bulb change message.
         2. Only one, but it takes him all night, and when he's done, the
            refrigerator and toilet don't work.
         3. At least a dozen, but it's impossible to tell which one it
            is, because they're all pointing at each other going "That's
            me, over there !"

          bulb?

          400. 1 to change the bulb, 50 to write a magazine about it, 50
          to write a help file about it, 50 to code a little gadget so
          when you hit the bulb it will announce all the names of the
          team involved, 50 to go down to the drinks machine and get
          everyone their can of coke, 50 to show off about how installing
          a light bulb for Bill has made them paper millionaires, 1 to
          answer the phone at the help desk ("Putting you through to our

         1. Hmmm, I'm not sure, better find out....
            Hmmm, I'm not sure, better find out....
            Note: LISP is a recursive programming language. One problem
            LISP programmers have to contend with is infinite recursion.
            (cf computer dictionary entry: recursion - see recursion)
            These lisp heads are usually research AI types and their
            standard answer is as in the punchline. It could be improved:
         2. (((H)mmm,) (I'm ((not) sure, better))) (find (out))...
            
   How many data base people does it take to change a light bulb?
          Three: One to write the light bulb removal program, one to

          socket to the '486 version.
          
   How many software vendors does it take to change a light bulb?
          None: You have to do it yourself, pay them $99 for the
          privilege, and re-wire your sockets to suit the new bulb.
          
   How many field service engineers does it take to replace a dead light
          bulb?
          
         1. Who can tell. FSE's are always in the dark.
         2. Two. One to hold the bulb and one to pound it in (etc)
         3. Well, the diagnostics all check out fine, so it's a software
            problem.

          other half definitions such as " 'bulb' can be defined as a
          glass and metal object with certain electrical properties (see
          volume IX, "The Electrical Properties Of A Bulb Used For
          Illumination") designed to mate with a housing integral to the
          ceiling referred to as a "socket" (see volume VII, "Bayonet Cap
          Sockets" and volume VIII, "Edison Screw Sockets"; if uncertain

         2. Did you try rebooting with extensions off?
         3. Just one, but the new light bulbs aren't compatible with the
            old sockets, so he has to buy a complete upgrade or a new
            light.
         4. Two: One to ask the socket to eject the old bulb, and one to
            insert the new one.

            for changing the bulb, and one to call in the lawyers on
            anyone who infringes on the "look and feel" of the bulb

          arguing. Finally a disgusted generic computer user (who will
          use any type that is in front of him) gets up and changes the
          bulb, elbowing the participants aside. The size of the crowd
          arguing seems to be a function of time, although whether or not
          the function is exponential is not known.

          word.
          Note: Refers to Netscape Corp., which distributed betas of
          their Web browser for free, announcing that the final version
          will be free also. Once the final version was out, they changed
          their mind. Only for students, educators and employees of
          non-profit organisations does it remain free.

        In earlier work, Wiener [1] has shown that one mathematician can
            change a light bulb.
            If k mathematicians can change a light bulb, and if one more
            simply watches them do it, then k+1 mathematicians will have
            changed the light bulb.
            Therefore, by induction, for all n in the positive integers,
            n mathematicians can change a light bulb.

            Note: Someone has been asking this as a bonus question on
            statistics exam papers for quite a while. Judging from some
            of his own students' exam answers, it depends on whether the
            light bulb is negatively or positively screwed.

         3. The probability that the light bulb will actually be changed
            in any time interval is independent of how long you've been
            waiting.

   How many quantum physicists does it take to change a light bulb?
          One. Two to do it, and one to renormalise the wave function.
          (Explanation - Renormalising the wave function is something
          that has to be done to a lot of quantum physics calculations to

          to operate the vacuum pump to get rid of the air in the bulb
          and one to apply the glue to seal the new bulb into the old
          base. The new bulb won't work, of course, but the whole process
          uses up a lot of expensive equipment and keeps several
          intelligent people happily employed doing something totally
          useless.

            decides whether to make it priority case. Job booked.
            Supervisor (4) decides whether it should be done individually
            or with other jobs. Order is placed in maintenance man's
            pigeonhole. Maintenance man (5) fills in ticket describing
            job. He picks up the parts needed. He goes to scene of faulty
            light bulb. He fits bulb or discovers he cannot mend light.
            He returns to department and reports back. He completes work
            ticket putting this in writing. Work ticket is checked by
            maintenance department to see whether order carried out. Then
            checked to see task completed in time set out under
            department guidelines. Ticket filed. Member of department (6)

          PR people try to force reporters to work their stories by
          talking to the PR person. Alas, the PR person never actually

                 for it!
              2. Just one, but he gets 3 hours of credit for it. (or the
                 Heisman, if Barry Switzer can get enough Alumni support
                 for it) Note: The Heisman is a trophy awarded to the
                 supposed best overall college football player each
                 season by the NY Athletic Club. Barry Switzer was
                 formerly the University of Oklahoma football coach, one
                 of the winningest ever. The joke relates to the fact
                 that the school's publicity department has as much, if
                 not more, to do with getting the Heisman than the
                 player's actual ability.
                 (Commentary from another American! Not exactly... OU has
                 had a few Heisman trophy winners, but only one of them
                 when Switzer was head coach (thus the joke's really not
                 that funny). Now if you changed it to Woody Hayes,
                 former head coach at coach at Ohio State, or Bo
                 Schembechler, former Michigan head coach, it might be
                 more humorous.)

            (Commentary from an American: Oh, please <groan> :-). I live
            in Buffalo, so it's a slightly sore subject. This relates to
            recent Super Bowls. The Broncos have been to four Super
            Bowls, and lost three by huge margins-"blowouts". Likewise
            the Bills, the pride and joy of our city, have lost the last
            three straight, the last two by overwhelming margins.)

                 minute, one to pretend to twist the new one in round and
                 round so far it almost breaks, and some guy in a black
                 and white stripey uniform whose function is never made

            That depends on the speed of the changer, and the mass of the
            bulb. Or vice versa, of course. Then it just might be easier

            relative.

                 evolved over many years by small steps,
               o There must be no discrimination against dark bulbs in
                 any form, and means must be found for all dark bulbs to
                 take their place alongside light bulbs on a basis of
                 equality,
               o We affirm the right of all bulbs to screw into the
                 sockets of their choice regardless of the bulb's
                 illumination preference, and
               o We seek for each light bulb the fullest opportunity to
                 develop itself to its full electrical potential.
        A second Unitarian to read this statement, even if he or she is
            the only human being to do so, and then write the obligatory

            first one.
            Notes on the previous 3: Chassidim (pronounced
            "hass-ee-deem"-it's Hebrew) are an orthodox Jewish sect. The
            jokes above refer to various further subsects and their
            peculiarities. The Lubavitchers, the most prevalent, are
            known for their belief that the Mossiach (Messiah) will be
            coming along soon. The Bratzlaver joke refers to the fact
            that they all revered their founder, the Rabbi Nachman, and
            since he died they haven't really replaced him, as nobody in
            the group feels capable of filling his shoes. The Satmar are
            very strict in their adherence to the sex-role distinctions
            prescribed by the Bible-in one area, they've been fighting
            with local authorities about school busing, because they
            believe that women should not be allowed to drive, and the
            school system employs a lot of women as bus drivers.

                 be bothered to do a simple thing like change a light
                 bulb for them, and after all they've done for you...

                 behind her back.

              2. None. It's not the light bulb that needs changing.
              3. Who cares as long as one of 'em sucks my cock.
              4. "Hey man, screwing objectifies the LB"
              5. Two..............IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH
                 THAT?????!!!!???
              6. Two - one to change the bulb and one to write about how
                 it feels.
              7. Two - one to change it and one to threaten to do a
                 Lorena Bobbitt on any man who tries to interfere.
              8. Three - one to do it, the others to consider unscrewing
                 it before it's a third of the way in.
              9. Three - one to screw it in and two to talk about the
                 sexual implications.
             10. Five, four to try like men and fail miserably, one to
                 find a female electrician, settle for a man and picket
                 as he works.
             11. Seven. One to change the light bulb, three to protest
                 the offense committed by the light bulb in regards to
                 the socket, two to secretly wish they were the socket,
                 and one to secretly wish she was the light bulb.
             12. 11. 1 to change the light bulb and 10 to form a
                 survivors of darkness support group!
             13. Seventy. One to change it while the others make a 69.
             14. 100. One to change it, and 99 to wring their hands and
                 agonize about how oppressed the socket is.
             15. How old-fashioned. The other 99 are there to lobby
                 Congress to outlaw crimes against sockets -- and to say
                 the bulb-changer is not a representative of mainstream
                 feminism.
             16. 50,000 marching on Ottawa (or Washington) demanding the
                 LB be changed!
             17. That depends. If there is money in it, it takes 10
                 women-only-government- contractors working 2 years at a
                 salary of $50,000 per year. Otherwise, it's
                 traditionally expected for the man to do it.
             18. Ten: To form a university funded protest committee to
                 research how the white male patriarchy conspires to keep
                 women and minorities in the dark.
             19. Two. One to threaten that as a mother, she will be
                 unable to provide her children light without federal
                 assistance; and a N.O.W. attorney to ask the Justice
                 Department to sue GE for allowing the bulb to go out in
                 the first place.
             20. Nobody knows. But everyone knows that women and
                 minorities will suffer more than anyone else because
                 it's dark.
             21. None. Women have a supreme court, constitionally
                 protected right to work in the dark if they choose to.
             22. It's sexual harassment to even SUGGEST jokingly on the
                 net that a woman SCREW in anything. This posting will be
                 banned by the FCC.
             23. One. But if the bulb IS replaced, the job will go to a
                 minority or woman contractor.
             24. 30,000 to start a letter writing campaign protesting
                 Newt Gingrich cutting off funds for the Federal Light
                 Bulb Changing Agency...
             25. Three. One to screw it in, and two to file a sexual
                 harassment lawsuit on behalf of the bulb.
             26. Two. One to wait for a federal agency to send someone to
                 screw it in. Another to file harassment charges against
                 the men possibly looking at her in the dark.
             27. Feminists don't screw at all. That's what sperm banks
                 are for!
             28. If a feminist does screw in a light bulb, it will be up
                 to the government or the father to support any children
                 resulting from such a sexual act. She will also require
                 free day care for the light bulb children and federal
                 funding for studies of how light-bulb children should be
                 treated under affirmative action hiring quotas.
             29. Unknown. But the federal government's welfare reform
                 will limit the number of free light bulbs a woman can
                 receive to under 2 years supply.

                 stop at the next uncharted planet, Alpha Regula IV, to
                 procure a light bulb from the natives. Kirk, Spock,
                 Bones, Sulu, and 3 red shirt security officers beam
                 down. The 3 security officers are promptly killed by the
                 natives, and the rest of the landing party is captured.
                 Meanwhile, back in orbit, Scotty notices a Klingon ship
                 approaching and must warp out of orbit to escape
                 detection. Bones cures the native king who is suffering
                 from the flu, and as a reward the landing party is set
                 free and given all of the light bulbs they can carry.
                 Scotty cripples the Klingon ship and warps back to the
                 planet just in time to beam up Kirk et. al. The new bulb
                 is inserted, and the Enterprise continues with its five
                 year mission.
        Three blondes are attempting to change a light bulb. One of them
            decides to call 911:
             Blonde:
                    We need help. We're three blondes changing a light
                    bulb.
             Operator:
                    Hmmmmm. You put in a fresh bulb?
             Blonde:
                    Yes.
             Operator:
                    The power in the house in on?
             Blonde:
                    Of course.
             Operator:
                    And the switch is on?
             Blonde:
                    Yes, yes.
             Operator:
                    And the bulb still won't light up?
             Blonde:
                    No, it's working fine.
             Operator:
                    Then what's the problem?
             Blonde:
                    We got dizzy spinning the ladder around and we all
                    fell and hurt ourselves.
        How many congressmen does it take to change a light bulb?
            Five hundred and thirty-five, but only if the following
            conditions are met: The light bulb will not be changed in an
            election year. A committee will study the light-bulb
            situation for at least a year. Taxes will have to be raised.
            A fair and proportionate number of the light-bulb changers
            will be from minority groups. No Social Security funds will
            be used to change the bulb. Each state and congressional
            district will share in the benefits of changing the light
            bulb. The blame for the failure of the present bulb will be
            assigned to the other party. The new bulb will be twice as
            bright as the old bulb. Because the new bulb is twice as
            bright as the old bulb, it will cost 130 times as much. A
            Blue Ribbon Panel will investigate the light-bulb failures
            and issue a mega-page report to the congress. A fact-finding
            trip to all countries known to produce light bulbs will be
            made by most congressmen and their wives. The CIA will
            investigate the Russian light-bulb-changing system. Details
            of the Russian light-bulb-changing system will be sold to the
            Chinese by an American naval officer. The surgeon general
            will issue a report about the perils of over-bright light
            bulbs. A program to supply light bulbs to those who cannot
            afford them will be introduced by Tip O'Neill. President
            Reagan will give a speech extolling the virtues of kerosene
            lanterns. Tip O'Neall will initiate a program of free
            kerosene for the needy. And finally, each and every
            congressman will send every one of his constituents a
            newsletter describing how he managed to get the light bulb
            changed almost single-handedly.
        How many lawyers does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. It only takes one lawyer to change your light bulb to
                 his light bulb.
              2. You won't find a lawyer who can change a light bulb.
                 Now, if you're looking for a lawyer to screw a light
                 bulb...
              3. Whereas the party of the first part, also known as
                 "Lawyer", and the party of the second part, also known
                 as "Light Bulb", do hereby and forthwith agree to a
                 transaction wherein the party of the second part (Light
                 Bulb) shall be removed from the current position as a
                 result of failure to perform previously agreed upon
                 duties, i. E., the lighting, elucidation, and otherwise
                 illumination of the area ranging from the front (north)
                 door, through the entryway, terminating at an area just
                 inside the primary living area, demarcated by the
                 beginning of the carpet, any spillover illumination
                 being at the option of the party of the second part
                 (Light Bulb) and not required by the aforementioned
                 agreement between the parties. The aforementioned
                 removal transaction shall include, but not be limited
                 to, the following steps:
                   1. The party of the first part (Lawyer) shall, with or
                      without elevation at his option, by means of a
                      chair, stepstool, ladder or any other means of
                      elevation, grasp the party of the second part
                      (Light Bulb) and rotate the party of the second
                      part (Light Bulb) in a counter-clockwise direction,
                      this point being non-negotiable.
                   2. Upon reaching a point where the party of the second
                      part (Light Bulb) becomes separated from the party
                      of the third part ("Receptacle"), the party of the
                      first part (Lawyer) shall have the option of
                      disposing of the party of the second part (Light
                      Bulb) in a manner consistent with all applicable
                      state, local and federal statutes.
                   3. Once separation and disposal have been achieved,
                      the party of the first part (Lawyer) shall have the
                      option of beginning installation of the party of
                      the fourth part ("New Light Bulb"). This
                      installation shall occur in a manner consistent
                      with the reverse of the procedures described in
                      step one of this self-same document, being careful
                      to note that the rotation should occur in a
                      clockwise direction, this point also being
                      non-negotiable.
             NOTE: The above described steps may be performed, at the
                 option of the party of the first part (Lawyer), by any
                 or all persons authorized by him, the objective being to
                 produce the most possible revenue for the party of the
                 fifth part, also known as "Partnership."
        How many workers at Rocky Flats, the former nuclear weapon
            components plant in Golden, Colo., should it take to change a
            light bulb?
            Sixteen--and that's no joke:
            
            An internal memo written by a manager at the U.S. Department
            of Energy plant recommended a new safety procedure for "the
            replacement of a light bulb in a criticality beacon." The
            beacon, similar to the revolving red lamp atop a police car,
            warns workers of nuclear accidents. The memo said the job
            should take at least 16 people over 60 hours to replace the
            light. It added that the same job used to take 12 workers
            4.15 hours.
            
            The memo called for a planner to meet with six others at a
            work-control meeting; talk with other workers who have done
            the job before; meet again; get signatures from five people
            at that work-control meeting; get the project plans approved
            by separate officials overseeing safety, logistics, waste
            management and plant scheduling; wait for a monthly
            criticality-beacon test; direct electricians to replace the
            bulb; and then test and verify the repair. Mark Obmascik in
            Denver Post (reprinted in Reader's Digest)
        How many 'Cliffie girls does it take to change a light bulb?
            It's "Radcliffe Women" and it's not funny!
            Note: Radcliffe is the all-women's college near Harvard that
            used to be where women went before Harvard went co-ed. Since
            then it has earned a reputation for militant feminism as it
            has remained all-female. The joke is on feminists' supposed
            failure to laugh along at deprecatory remarks.
        How many Bratzlaver Chassidim does it take to change a light
            bulb?
            None. They will never find one that burned as brightly as the
            first one.
        How many <ethnics> does it take to screw in a light bulb?
              1. We don't know yet. No <ethnic> has ever tried to attempt
                 this complex (by <ethnic> standards) technical feat.
              2. 10. One to hold the bulb and nine to rotate the ladder.
        How many strong <ethnics> does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            115. One to hold the bulb and 114 to rotate the house.
        How many <ethnic> gods does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            Two. One to hold the bulb and the other to rotate the planet.
        How many cabbage patch dolls does it take to change a light bulb?
            
            the question is irrelevant since you couldn't find the dolls
            even if you knew how many.
            Note: Topical to 1983 and the difficulty of obtaining cabbage
            patch dolls
        How many board meetings does it take to get a light bulb changed?
            
            This topic was resumed from last week's discussion, but is
            incomplete pending resolution of some action items. It will
            be continued next week. Meanwhile...
        How many assholes does it take to change a light bulb?
            None, assholes never see the light anyway.
        How many WASP Princesses does it take to screw in a light bulb?
              1. What?! And ruin my nails???
              2. Two. One to get a Tab and one to call Daddy.
              3. Two. One to call the electricion and one to fix the
                 Martinis.
              4. Three: Two to bitch about it, one to call the building
                 superintendant.
        Note: WASP Princess = spoilt rich girl, a Tab = a can of Tab the
            drink.
        How many junkies does it take to screw in a light bulb?
              1. Oh wow, is it like dark, man?
              2. Two: One to roll it, and one to light it up.
        How many recovering addicts does it take to screw in a light
            bulb?
              1. One, but it takes twelve steps.
              2. One, as long as he admits he's powerless over light
                 bulbs.
              3. One to screw it in and one to sponsor him.
        How many pot growers does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            None, they use fluorescent bulbs instead.
        How many Pygmies does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            At least three.
            Note: think height!
        How many existentialists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            Two: One to screw it in and one to observe how the light bulb
            itself symbolizes a single incandescent beacon of subjective
            reality in a netherworld of endless absurdity reaching out
            toward a maudlin cosmos of nothingness.
        How many dull people does it take to change a light bulb?
            one.
        How many big black monoliths does it take to change a light bulb?
            
            Sorry, light bulbs are an evolutionary dead end.
        How many philosophers does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Hmmm... well there's an interesting question isn't it?
              2. Three. One to change it and two to stand around arguing
                 over whether or not the light bulb exists.
              3. Define "light bulb".................
        How many Random Light Bulb Joke readers does it take to screw in
            a light bulb?
            None. They just wait for a new one to be loaded.
        How many Mensans does it take to screw in a litebulb?
            None. They know that litebulb is misspelled and therefore
            cannot exist to be screwed in. Now of course, if it were a
            Miller Lite bulb...
        How many Mensans does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. None. The bulb isn't bright enough.
              2. None. The dim bulbs aren't "changed," they are humanely
                 euthanized.
              3. 66. Eleven philosophers to ponder whether it is possible
                 to actually do anything; ten semanticists to debate the
                 various possible meanings of each phrase, word, and
                 syllable; nine columnists to write about it from
                 radically different viewpoints; eight letter writers to
                 respond vehemently with opposing points of view; seven
                 Quibblers who delight in pointing out others' mistakes
                 (what is said is not as important as saying it
                 correctly); six conservatives who believe things should
                 stay the way they are; five liberals who believe that
                 action should be taken immediately to form a committee
                 to study possible actions; four ornery SOBs who disagree
                 on principal with anything anyone else has suggested;
                 three peacemakers who believe it's more important to
                 work it out without showing any more emotions than
                 necessary to get it done; two statisticians who maintain
                 that numbers are more important than facts; and one
                 pragmatist to ignore the BS and replace the bad bulb
                 with a good one. Whilst all this is going on, all the
                 Mensans are keeping count in their heads just to make
                 absolutely sure that it really does add up to 66.
        How many light bulbs does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. One, if it knows its own Goedel number.
                 Note: A Goedel Number is one of several ways to encode a
                 Turing Machine, the classical abstraction of a computer,
                 or for that matter of any algorithm. The idea (as best I
                 see it) is that if the machine knows its own Goedel
                 Number it can simulate itself... It does come from the
                 mathematician Goedel - partly because he used TMs in his
                 famous theorem, I believe.
              2. Two, the new one and the old one. (hahahahah ???)
        How many dadaists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            To get to the other side.
        How many Democratic presidential candidates from 1988 did it take
            to screw in a light bulb?
              1. (Mike Dukakis) In Massachusetts, my enlightened
                 government has made it unnecessary for people to screw
                 in their own light bulbs, as we have put thousands of
                 former welfare recipients to work for the Dept. of Light
                 Bulb Installation. These employees will come to your
                 home or business and install any incandescent bulb, on
                 only a few months notice.
              2. (Bruce Babbitt) It's foolish to talk about screwing in
                 light bulbs when we haven't even taken the first step,
                 and that is to remove the old bulb. I challenge my
                 fellow candidates to stand up with me and help me remove
                 this old light bulb [stands, but nobody else does] Hah!
                 What wimps. You guys make Bush look like Rambo.
              3. (Richard Gephart) It doesn't matter whether the bulb is
                 changed or not; it only matters that the new bulb was
                 made in the US of A. Taiwan and South Korea have put up
                 massive barriers to importing US light bulbs; we'll see
                 how they like it when their bulbs cost $10,000 to screw
                 in here.
              4. (Gary Hart) This oblique reference to screwing is an
                 obvious attempt to drag my personal life into this
                 campaign. Frankly, I resent it, and the American people
                 resent it.
              5. (Al Gore) As usual, the other left-wing wacko candidates
                 are putting forth solutions that moderate Southerners
                 won't cotton to on Super Tuesday. At least I hope not.
              6. (Paul Simon) My media experts tell me I'm foolish for
                 wearing my hair the same way I did in the 50's. But
                 that's what Paul Simon's all about. And I suppose my
                 media experts are gonna say I'm foolish for this, but in
                 all candor, I change my light bulbs the same way I did
                 in the 50's: my wife gets on a ladder and I turn it.
              7. (Jesse Jackson) Changing the light bulb is a partial
                 solution at best. I'm more of a Lone Ranger than a light
                 bulb changer. But even the Lone Ranger had Tonto and
                 Silver, and the shameful fact is that the American
                 Indians of today don't have enough silver, or gold, or
                 even paper money to allow them to buy into the American
                 Dream or some extra light bulbs. We must ensure that all
                 Americans can light their homes, from the lighthouse to
                 the White House.
        How many Republican Presidential candidates from 1988 did it take
            to change a light bulb?
              1. (Dole) When I was a poor boy growing up in Kansas we
                 didn't have light bulbs. Now I have the housekeeper do
                 it.
              2. (DuPont) Light bulbs need to be changed? Gosh. I guess
                 the servants have always taken care of that... With a
                 DuPont administration, the power of the free market will

                 media are keeping this thing alive. I think the American

                 room, citing the extreme density of the 6, 12 to demand
                 that this commentary be redirected to the other room, 14
                 to ask that the bulb be changed again, since they missed
                 seeing it the first time, and 496 (a bit excessive, but
                 it's not my joke) to climb all over each other, trying
                 to put the old bulb back in.
              4. An infinitely growing number : - One to announce that
                 the bulb burned out. Ten to agree. One to change it, one
                 to post in saying "I got it", one to post in saying
                 "Yes, but they have shots for it nowadays", one to post
                 in saying "Our news software hasn't been working and I
                 missed the original light bulb joke. Would someone
                 please post it again or email it to me?", one to post in
                 quoting everything so far and the words "Me too", two to
                 turn it into a cascade, another ten to build the cascade
                 into a disk-wasting monster, one to post in with "I
                 don't get it. Isn't this the place for FUNNY jokes?",
                 one to post in after two months "What's this light bulb
                 joke you're all talking about?", one to repost it a
                 month later thinking it's a new joke, one to post "I
                 didn't get it. What's the punchline?", one to post "Has
                 anyone got a list of these? I'm starting a list, so
                 please send me all your light bulb jokes", and one to
                 cross-post the joke to alt.fan.lightbulbs 6 months later
                 prefixed by "Are we allowed to tell jokes in here?" and
                 accompanied by all of our old favourites like "How many
                 programmers...? None that's a hardware problem.", three
                 to ask, a month later, "What FTP sites are the old light
                 bulbs archived at?", and any number to revive the entire
                 exchange at stochastic intervals of two to six months.
        How many alt.fan.pratchett readers does it take to change a light
            bulb?
            Four. One to actually change the bulb, one to write amusing
            footnotes about it, one to propose to Laura, and a newbie to
            ask if that's really THE Terry Or colette or both, and then
            to realise that the speed of light can't be measured, except
            in badgers, or possibly multiple of pi, then to say sod it
            and ask if anyone knows where to find the lyrics for the
            hedgehog song...
        How many DR. ROCKETs does it take to change a light bulb?
            juSt ONe, BUt he CHAngES It tO RADioACtIVE dusT WItH HIs
            NuclEAR WArHead!!
        How many Nitpicks does it take to change a light bulb?
            None. They just let someone else change it, then they point
            out all the mistakes the bulb-changer made!
        How many EXPLAINORs does it take to change a light bulb?
            None, because The KILLOR killed him!
            (Note : The last 3 all refer to personalities in the
            rec.humor group.)
        How many AOL users does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Two. One to screw in the light bulb, and one to watch
                 him to make sure he doesn't say 'nipple'.
              2. Eight. One screws in the light bulb, but seven more do
                 too, due to a software bug.
              3. Eleven. One to ask to be on the light bulb gif mailing
                 list, nine to say "ME TOO!", and another to post a
                 message asking for the intructions on how to view a
                 light bulb.
                 Note: If you don't beleive me, see the
                 alt.binaries.pictures.supermodels,
                 alt.binaries.pictures.celebreties, and alt.sex
                 newsgroups and you will see threads up to 10 "ME TOO!"s
                 long consisting of all AOL'ers requesting to be put on
                 non exisitent .gif/ftp mailing lists. Internet folklore
                 tells us that all the gits are on AOL. The software
                 they're using is only partly to blame.
        How many VEGAN-L subscribers does it take to change a light bulb?
            
            Most of them. One to change it and post a little joke about
            it to the list, one to post in saying "I got it", one to post
            in saying "Yes, but they have herbal remedies for it
            nowadays", one to post "And homeopathic ones too, I read
            somewhere", one to post in saying he accidentally deleted the
            original light bulb joke and could someone please post it
            again or email it to him, one to post in quoting everything
            so far and the words "Me too", two to turn it into a cascade,
            one to post "What's this light bulb joke you're all talking
            about then?", one to post "I dunno, it sounds like some kind
            of food", one to post "In that case, has anyone got a recipe
            for one then?", one to post in requesting Michael Traub look
            up and tell us all its B12 content, one to post "Will it help
            cure my auntie's arthritis?", one to assert that it probably
            won't, but its effectiveness at this might well be increased
            by accompanying it with some shiatsu and meditation, two to
            condemn that as too unscientific, one to ask whether light
            bulbs are totally vegan, one to post "Read the FAQ", one
            assert that they are and add "I like light bulbs. They're low
            in fat, and stay crunchy in soya milk too !", one to announce
            that she's leaving the list unless the discussion gets a bit
            more meaningful, three to post in reassuring her that
            eventually it will, Lissa Mosley to post that the list
            moderators feel they must respectfully request that the
            discussion be moved to private email as it has been going on
            far too long, one to agree with this and add "So what has all
            this got to do with ethical veg*nism anyway?" and suggest the
            discussion be moved to alt.fan.lightbulbs , and one to post
            in quoting this suggestion and add "What's that?". So the
            discussion moves to usenet, as our intrepid vegan-l
            subscribers venture beyond the boundaries of email, and
            alt.fan.lightbulbs finds itself taking a few days off from
            the "My incredible light" and "Light Bulb death" discussions
            and come up with some new jokes...
        How many alt.sex.stories readers does it take to change a light
            bulb?
            Cindy fondled the burnt-out bulb whilst beads of sweat
            glistened on her perfectly rounded breast... Her brother
            Billy had gone to the hardware store to get a new light bulb.
            Suddenly the door opened and there he stood, silhouetted
            against the sharp light from the doorway. She could see the
            bulge in his pants.. "They didn't have any light bulbs but
            wait'll you get a load of my hardware", he said as he started
            unzipping his pants...
        How many uk.singles readers does it take to change a light bulb?
            Most of them. One female to notice that it had gone out and
            post something about how light bulbs are so masculine to the
            group, two to post in disagreeing with this, Susan Macran to
            post "Bog off stumpy!", a whole terminal room in Keele to sit
            there discussing it only among themselves, one to post a
            coherent critique of Susan Macran's last post, Kate Smith to
            complain that the women always get flamed more than the men,
            Menya to say that light bulbs are sexy as long as they're
            orange and could someone bring her a nice hot one, and two
            people to post in suggesting a boink so they can all get
            together and change the light bulb, with real friendship and
            good lighting not relationships uppermost in their minds.
            During all this time, not one person dares risk losing points
            by posting a personals ad.
        How many alt.pagan.* group readers does it take to change a light
            bulb
              1. None. Torches are more traditional.
              2. 23. One to change the bulb and 22 to argue how their
                 family tradition regarding light bulbs is more justified
                 and ancient than anyone else's.
        How many IRC chatters does it take to change a light bulb?
            None. They're so busy saying hello, goodbye, and kicking each
            other off that noone ever has enough time to get anything
            done !
        How many humor theorists does it take to submit a light bulb
            joke?
            300 - one to change the bulb and 299 to analyze it to death.
        How many netters does it take to submit a light bulb joke?
              1. 1000 - One to invent the joke and 999 to submit "How
                 many programmers does it take to screw in a light bulb?
                 None, that's a hardware problem."
              2. 2, 1 to do it and 1 to read this huge file first to
                 check it hasn't been done already!
        How many light bulb jokes does it take to change a light bulb
            joke?
            Hmmmm - the probability that a given light bulb joke will be
            submitted to the net in any given week is .4, and the
            probability that it will have changed detectably since the
            last transmission is .2 . Hence (assuming independence, which
            is reasonable since no submitter of a light bulb joke ever
            seems to know it has been submitted before, within the last 2
            or 3 weeks), the probability that it will change in a given
            week is .08. So it takes about 12.5 light bulb jokes to
            change a light bulb joke.
        How many knock-knock jokes does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            
            Who's there?
        How many GLC workers does it take to change a light bulb?
            Four. One to do it and three to go round putting up posters
            announcing that the GLC, working for London, is going to
            change the light bulb.
        How many carpenters does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            Sod you! That's the electrician's job.

            As many as are happy screwing in light bulbs.
        How many Newtons does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Foux! There to eat lemons, axe gravy soup.
              2. Farm.
        How many Newton users does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            Only one, tharks to the extnq-producilve handwritling
            processcr.
            Note: refers to the Newton's poor handwriting recognition
            techniques.
        How many surrealists does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Two. One to hold the giraffe and the other to fill the
                 bathtub with brightly colored machine tools.
              2. Two. One to change it and one to throw a bucket of water
                 out the window. (An interesting story about this joke -
                 it was once being told at a party or something, and the
                 person being asked correctly made up a completely
                 irrelevant answer, and was promptly corrected by a loud
                 chorus of "No, it's a fish !")
        How many fish does it take to change a light bulb?
            surrealist.
        How many modern artists does it take to change a light bulb?
            Four; one to throw bulbs against the wall, one to pile
            hundreds of them in a heap and spray-paint it orange, one to
            glue light bulbs to a cocker spaniel, and one to put a bulb
            in the socket and fill the room with light while all the
            critics and buyers are watching the fellow smashing the bulbs
            against the wall, the fellow with the spray-gun, and the
            cocker spaniel. (what goes clink-clink-clink, ow-woooo?)
        How many sado-masochists does it take to change a light bulb?
            Two. One to hold it and one to kick the chair out from under
            him.
        How many Paul Daniels does it take to change a light bulb?
            None. "And that's magic !"
        How many Will Rogers' does it take to change a dead light bulb?
            None. He never met a dead light bulb he didn't like.
        How many computer security experts does it take to change a light
            bulb?
            "That depends on the TCSEC rating of the object light bulb.
            If it's a C2 bulb (or below), one. If a B1 bulb, just one,
            but he/she must document the potential covert channel. If a
            B2 bulb, he/she must also audit the covert channel. If a
            B3/A1 bulb, none, since covert channels are not allowed. [See
            also the "Orange Book"]
        How many Systems Assurance testers does it take to change a light
            bulb?
            None. We just noticed the room was dark. We don't fix the
            problems, we just find them.
        How many SAS programmers does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. How many?
              2. It depends : - If they are applications programmers, it
                 takes exactly twice as many as are currently available.
                 If they are host programmers, it takes one for each
                 variant of Unix and/or MicroSoft Windows. If they are
                 core programmers, it only takes one. He just holds the
                 bulb to the socket and waits for the world to revolve
                 around him.
              3. One to analyze the historical failure rates of light
                 bulbs using PROC LIFEREG, so as to anticipate the
                 failure of the light bulb before the user actually has
                 to report it, one to explain why SAS is better for
                 changing light bulbs than S-Plus, SPSS/X, BMDP, SYSTAT,
                 MINITAB or a spreadsheet, one to write a custom
                 interface in AF/SCL allowing the user to manually
                 request the changing of the light bulb after its failure
                 (prematurely) occurs, one to write a report with PROC
                 SQL and PROC REPORT which will summarize the light bulbs
                 needing to be changed, sorted twelve different ways,
                 cross-indexed (by wattage, type, and
                 prematureness-of-failure) and totaled, one to actually
                 spin the light bulb into the socket using SAS/Insight,
                 one to call Cary to try to get them to explain when a
                 new version of the light bulb will ship, how much we'll
                 pay to keep using light bulbs for another year, and what
                 we'll do if our site sends all its light bulbs to Europe
                 where 120V/60Hz light bulbs tend to explode upon
                 insertion in 220V/50Hz circuits, one to write an
                 incomprehensible ten line SAS macro program which will
                 perpetually insert new filaments into all mission
                 critical light bulbs until its author is fired, at which
                 point the SAS macro will automatically encode itself
                 into a copy of the latest SAS/ETS usage notes, one to
                 write a graphical front end to the light bulb changing
                 process using SAS/EIS, with little speedometers showing
                 the number of light bulbs changed per hour, so that
                 management can understand why we need to buy bigger
                 light bulbs, one to prepare a SUGI paper summarizing the
                 entire light bulb project, taking credit for the design
                 and execution of the light bulb project itself as well
                 as the invention of the light bulb itself, another one
                 to prepare a second SUGI paper benchmarking light bulb
                 replacement on twelve different types of light sockets,
                 with separate graphs for florescent and incandescent
                 bulbs (made with SAS/Graph, except for the titling,
                 axes, color, polylines, and background, which were all
                 added manually with Cricket Graph on a Mac), ten to push
                 the dollie loaded with SAS/Light Bulb manuals, and, One
                 more to ask SAS-L for help when you really need to
                 change that bulb, now.
              4. Zero. We have the housekeeping staff do it for us.
              5. Please let us know!
              6. That depends; what color is the bulb?
              7. It all depends on whether they can read the manuals or
                 not. That needs to be in there somewhere as a qualifier!
              8. They can't change light bulbs... Without light, they
                 can't read the manual, and without the manual, they
                 can't figure out how to change the light bulb.
              9. This can not be computed. Changing light bulbs is a
                 hardware problem...
             10. Two. One to change the light bulb and one to make sure
                 the stack of manuals doesn't tip over.
             11. One, once the documentation for the procedure is found
                 in one of the 15 manuals on the shelf.
             12. Well, it depends upon the platform on which one stands!
             13. Actually none, if you are willing to close your eyes to
                 the (validity of the) output.
             14. It can't be done yet. "Light bulb" is more than 8
                 characters long.
        How many APL hackers does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            None. There's a primitive for that.
            Note: I don't do APL but I think a primitive is a procedure
            that is included as a part of the language. You don't have to
            write code ("hack") to do it.
        How many Technical Support staff does it take to change a light
            bulb?
              1. "Well, we have an exact copy of your light bulb here and
                 it seems to be working OK. Can you be more specific
                 about the exact problem?..."
              2. I'm sorry, we don't support that kind of lighting
                 technology.
              3. Our engineers are busy at the moment... We have assigned
                 query number 987632 to your question. Please refer to it
                 in all future correspondence.
        How many WordPerfect support technicians does it take to change a
            light bulb?
            We have an exact copy of the light bulb here, and it seems to
            be working fine. Can you tell me what kind of system you
            have? Ok. Now, exactly how dark is it? Ok, there could be

            ensuing squabble the bulb gets dropped on the floor and
            smashes. Then crusty #5 points out what a good laugh this is
            and so chief crusty (#6) dispatches crusties #7 and #8 to go
            down the shops to buy a new one. After having visited at
            least 2 off licences on the way, they find their way into the
            hardware shop. While crusty #7 is busily trying to buy 6 new
            bulbs for the princely sum of 10p each and a can of special
            brew, crusty #8 is busy liberating as many as will fit into
            his long grey shapeless overcoat's pockets. They are joined
            on the way back by crusties #9 and #10 whose names they've
            forgotten but they do at least sound familiar, and much
            frivolous hugging ensues until someone remembers what the
            trip down the shops was all about. On their way back into the
            squat they pass crusty #11, who has only just joined the
            group, and who is just on his way out to go and get his hair
            crimped. Anyway once inside, the light bulbs are all smashed
            on the floor and the stereo is cranked up so the dancing can
            begin. At this point crusty #12 comes back in from a
            Levellers gig and collapses in a corner, only to find he is
            lying on something that makes a noise, which turns out to be
            the dog, holding the last unsmashed light bulb in its mouth.

                         Oh, yeah! The question. Ummmmm, Ummmmm, what is
                         the question, Butthead? Heh-heh. Heh-heh.
                         Heh-heh.
                  Butthead
                         Uuuuuuuh, I dunno know! Huh-uh-uh-uh-uh! I
                         thought you knew. Huh-uh-uh-uh-uh!
                  Beavis
                         I think I am having a stiffy. Heh-heh. Heh-heh.
                  Butthead
                         Oh, I remember! Huuuuuuuuh-uh-uh-uh-uh! I think
                         it was like, uh-uh, like how many, uh-uh, like
                         Beavis and Buttheads, huuuuuuuuuuh-uh-uh-uh-uh,
                         does take to screw in a, uh-uh, lightbulbs?
                  Beavis
                         I dunno know...
                  Butthead
                         Oh, I get it. Huuuuuuuh-uh-uh-uh-uh! I think he
                         means like our, uh-uh, ...
              3.
                 
                    Butthead
                            : "Uh huh huh huh huh. You said "Screw."
                            
                    Beavis
                            : "Yeah. Heh heh heh m heh heh. screw. Screw.
                            SCREW!"
                            
                    Butthead
                            : "Settle down, Beavis. Or I'll kick your
                            ass."
                            
        How many DIY buffs does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            Only one, but it takes him two weekends and three trips to
            the hardware store.
        How many blind people does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. It depends whether the switch is on or off.
              2. If the switch is off, one. If the switch is on, any
                 number, until one of them figures out to turn it off.
        How many deaf blind people does it take to change a light bulb?
            Depends on whether or not you can get them to notice the
            darkness...
        How many Victorians does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            <Ahem> We do not discuss this with ladies and children
            present.
        How many BATF agents does it take to screw in a light bulb?
              1. Four hundred to attempt to seize the old bulb and then
                 surround the house when it rebuffs them.
              2. It doesn't matter, they just burn down the house.
        Note: BATF is The US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms,
            repsonsible for setting up that Waco (We Aint Coming Out !)
            Branch Davidians siege in spring 1993, which ended in a
            fashion the second punchline suggests.
        How many xxxxxxx (fill in the blank: FBI agents, narcs, deans)
            does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            Six. One to seize the light bulb and the others hold him very
            very still, because they KNOW the world turns.
            (Someone please explain this one ! Surely it's not the same
            joke as egotists?)
        How many Supreme Court Justices does it take to screw in a light
            bulb?
            Nine-three to form a plurality, two to concur in part, two to
            dissent one to concur in part and dissent in part with the
            plurality opinion, and the last to concur with the dissenters
            in part.
        How many Hegelians does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            Two, of course. One stands at one end of the room and argues
            that it isn't dark; the other stands across from him and says
            that true light is impossible. This dialectic creates a
            synthesis when the bulb gets screwed in.
            Note: Hegel and Marx use a logical procedure called
            dialectics to seek answers to seemingly mutual exclusive
            positions. Shortened it is "thesis, antithesis, synthesis".
            Thus 'no light' and 'no dark' can arrive at a middle ground
            through logical examination 'it's dark but it can be made
            light'.
        How many Platonists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            They don't change bulbs, they have nice fires in their caves
            and if they need light they go out and look at the sun.
        How many New Historicists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            None-historical forces will do it. The bulb-screwer is a
            relatively modern invention.
        How many folklorists does it take to change a light bulb?
            Ten. One to change it and nine to document it.
        How many deconstructionists does it take to screw in a light
            bulb?
              1. It doesn't matter. Even if the bulb is screwed in, it
                 will always be flickering, however faintly, so it really
                 hasn't worked. It is incapable of delivering
                 uninterrupted light.
              2. You have to examine the nature of the question.
        How many chickens does it take to screw in a light bulb?
              1. Two-one to do it and one to cross the road.
              2. Just one, and she'll screw it in as soon as she decides
                 it isn't going to hatch.
              3. None. They're all far too busy crossing the road.
        How many kindergarden kids does it take to change a light bulb?
            One, two, three... Mummy! can I use my toes?
        How many Pizza Hut employees does it take to screw in a light
            bulb?
            Three-one to do it, one to hold the ladder, and one to tell
            the story about "last night."
            Note: This is guaranteed true by someone who used to work
            there. The stories refer to wild copious drinking and also a
            few bedroom exploits.
        How many undertakers does it take to change a light bulb?
            None. They just paint them black and go on using them.
        How many talk show hosts does it take to change a light bulb?
            Three, one to screw in the new bulb, one to ask the old one
            how it feels to be replaced, and one to take questions from
            the audience.
        How many gun control advocates does it take to screw in a light
            bulb?
              1. Let the police do it - private citizens can't be trusted
                 with light bulbs !
              2. They don't do that; they pass laws against burned-out
                 bulbs, and then they wonder why it's still so dark.
                 Meanwhile, a lot of people get hurt because they can't
                 see.
        How many NRA members does it take to screw in a light bulb?
              1. 3-One to give up the old bulb when they pry it from his
                 cold dead fingers, one to screw it in and pose for an
                 "I'm the NRA" ad while doing so, and one to complain
                 about the waiting period.
              2. Two, one to do it and the other one to get his dick out
                 of the gun.
        How many Newfies does it take to change a light bulb?
            Two. One to bite the bulb out of the socket and one to hammer
            the new one in. (A stereotype of Newfoundlanders as stupid -
            usually told by Canadians.)
        How many baby boomers does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            Ten-four to talk about how great it is that they've all come
            together to do this, one to screw it in, one to film it for
            the news, one to plan a marketing strategy based on it, one
            to reminisce about mass naked bulb screwings in the '60s, one
            to watch reruns of '50s TV shows, and one to play classic
            rock.
        How many (generation) Xers does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            
            Two, one to go and shoplift the bulb so the boomers have
            something to screw in and the other to screw it in for
            minimum wage.
        How many vampires does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            None, they like it in the dark.
        How many one-armed people does it take to change a light bulb?
            Only one, as long as he kept the till receipt.
        How many does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            Two, but they have to be really tiny.
        How many CND supporters does it take to change a light bulb?
            None. They won't, because:
               o "I'm not about to touch anything that has WATT written
                 on it!"
               o "If we change our bulb, they will just change theirs to
                 a brighter one, so where will it all end?"
               o "We already have enough bulbs to illuminate the entire
                 world three times over."
               o "We shouldn't spend money for light bulbs as long as
                 anyone is hungry anywhere."
               o "We don't know what effect all this artificial light
                 will have on the future of mankind."
               o "Nature provides us with all the light we need; we just
                 haven't learned to husband it yet."
               o "Artificial light isn't aesthetically correct."
               o "The candle is more traditional, and it uses no
                 electricity."
               o "It is the responsibility of the Federal Government to
                 provide light to all Americans, without regard to race,
                 age, creed, color sex (anatomic), sex (persuasion),
                 religion, socio-economic status, national origin, or
                 need."
        How many furries does it take to change a light bulb?
            Four. One to climb up the ladder and change the light bulb.
            Three to protect the first with overkill-type weaponry, wear
            clothing which emphasizes curves and musculature, and look
            cute and dangerous at the same time.
            Note: furries = characters in what's called "furry" science
            fiction. Best depicted on cover art; the men look like
            bodybuilders, the women are indescribably buxom, and both
            wear some version of Tarzan/Jane-style costumes to show as
            much skin and musculature as possible.
        How many furfen does it take to change a light bulb?
            Three. One to climb up the ladder and change the light bulb.
            One to complain that there was too much erotica in the
            previous answer and this one, and that people should come up
            with more non-erotic answers because of the impact on public
            negativity towards furriness. And the third to explain about
            their erotic dreams involving furry light bulb jokes.
            Note: furfen = fans of furries. "fen" is a long-used plural
            for "fan".
        How many editors of Poor Richard's Almanac does it take to
            replace a light bulb?
            Many hands make light work.
            Note: "Poor Richard's Almanac" is a classic of colonial
            Americana, written (pseudonymously) by Ben Franklin in the
            1740s. It advocates a simple, thrifty lifestyle in the form
            of aphorisms, including that one, so it makes a nice play on
            words.
        How many big black monoliths does it take to change a light bulb?
            
            Sorry, light bulbs are an evolutionary dead end.
            Note: It might be something to do with the film - 2001 Space
            Odyssey. It's more the book, actually. That and "The Lost
            Worlds of 2001" should help illuminate this one. The big
            black monoliths, according to the books, are meant to help
            man evolve, something sort of hinted at in the film but more
            explicitly stated in the books.
        How many light bulbs does it take to change a light bulb?
            One, if it knows its own Goedel number.
            (Could somebody please explain this one to me ! I think it's
            something to do with the maths/logic theories of Kurt Goedel,
            about it being impossible to prove things.)
        How many Bayesians/subjectivists does it take to screw in a light
            bulb?
            As many as you think it takes.
            P.S. Fortunately, the author has learned much about Bayesian
            inference (and about the subjectivity inherent in "classical"
            inference) since then -- so spare us the flames about the
            misperceptions on which the above joke is based.
        How many dadaists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            To get to the other side.
            Note: The "dadaist" answer, like dadaism itself, goes further
            than the surrealist one. Whereas the surrealist one at least
            bears the semblance of a relationship to the question, the
            dadaist one is the punchline to another joke entirely.
        How many spies does it take to change a light bulb?
            Why bother?
            (I guess the point is that spies like to do everything in the
            dark anyway?)
        How many EST followers does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            A roomful. They take turns as the leader tells them what
            rotten and worthless bulb screwers they are. No one is
            allowed to leave the room to go to the bathroom while the
            bulb screwing is in progress.
            Note: EST (Erhard Seminars Training) was some sort of
            self-esteem-building programme that was popular in the late
            1970s. The sessions were as described in the punchline.
        How many Amish does it take to screw in a light bulb?
              1. Two, one to hold the bulb and the other to tell him it's
                 against the will of God.
              2. Amish don't have light bulbs. They bake pies.
        Note: The Amish are a people, also known as the "Pennsylvania
            Dutch", who mostly (though not exclusively) live in
            southeastern Pennsylvania and are noted for their religion.
            They adhere to a strict code of living that forbids using
            such modern conveniences as electricity and automobiles, and
            indeed often look and act as if they were time travelers from
            the early nineteenth century (they drive around in horse and
            buggy carts). They are descended from German Protestant
            immigrants of that time (hence the "Dutch" as the immigration
            people misunderstood "Deutsch", the answer they gave for
            nationality). Their quaint lifestyle draws many people to SE
            PA every year, where they often have a chance to sample their
            sweet pies and cakes. Hence the joke.
        How many NSC members does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. We can't say.
              2. Three, in fourteen countries.
        Note: The NSC is the US National Security Council, whose rubric
            Oliver North was acting under, and which is often accused by
            people such as Gore Vidal of secretly governing the country.
        How many Dune Coons does it take to replace a light bulb?
            Three - one to hold the bulb and two to turn the stool, but
            they need a foreign adviser to tell them it was burned out.
            Note: I presume a "Dune Coon" means a 3rd world peasant.
        How many supply-siders does it take to change a light bulb?
            None. The darkness will cause the light bulb to change by
            itself.
            Note: "Supply-siders" were the force behind Reagan's early
            reforms, and their economic theories were just like those of
            Thatcher (only the Thatcherites were more extreme). They
            believed that if they shifted the focus of government
            economic policy to stimulating supply rather than demand, the
            business cycle would be stopped at an agreeable point and
            inflation would be permanently whipped. Obviously, it didn't
            quite work out that way.
        How many Ann Arborites does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            None, they just start a "Coping With Darkness" support group.
            Note: Ann Arbor is a where, not a who. It's the home of the
            University of Michigan, which has a fairly liberal
            reputation.
        How many Lacanians does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            Three-one to do it, one to desire it, and the ignorant Other.
            Note: Jacques Lacan (1901-82) was a prominent French
            psychoanalyst and theorist who is very influential with
            literary critics at the moment. This relates to his theories.
        How many gypsies does it take to change a light bulb?
            None, but you lose a lot of light bulbs.
            Note: None because gypsies don't have mains electricity, and
            the losing is a play on the larcenous reputation of Gypsies.
            You give a Gypsy a light bulb and ask him to change the
            hallway lamp, pretty soon you have one less light bulb and
            the hallway lamp is still out.
        How many Helmsley employees does it take to change a light bulb?
            100: 99 to try, and one to fire them all.
            Note: Leona Helmsley is the owner of a (New York?) hotel who
            was a real bitch to work for. She fired employees at little
            or no provocation.
        How many marginals does it take to change a light bulb?
            Two: One to screw it in real good, and one to call the
            proctologist.
            Note: Anyone know what a marginal is or does? It sounds like
            a rude reference to a supposed homosexual practice of putting
            foreign objects in each others' rectums. Perhaps "marginal"
            is some regional insulting term for some kind of male
            homosexual?
        How many Martians does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            One and a half. (Is this a science-fiction in-joke?)
        Why did the light bulb fall out of the tree?
              1. Cos it was doing an impersonation of the sun, setting.
              2. Cos Christmas tree decorations are always cheap and
                 nasty.
              3. Cos it was autumn. (eh?)
        (Thus combining the twin themes of light bulb jokes and jokes
            about things falling out of trees...)
        How many Tauruses does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. None: Tauruses don't like to change anything.
              2. One. But only if they can celebrate afterwards with a
                 ten course meal and some great sex.
              3. One, but just try to convince them that the burnt out
                 bulb is useless and should be thrown away.
        How many Geminis does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Two (of course) but it will take all week, and when
                 they're done the light bulb will do your homework, speak
                 French, and shine any color you want it to.
              2. Two. Plus a portable phone, an Internet link and a copy
                 of the 'Bluffer's Guide to Changing Light Bulbs.'
              3. Two, but they never change it - they just keep arguing
                 about who is supposed to do it and how it's supposed to
                 be done.
        How many Cancerians does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Just one. But it takes a therapist three years to help
                 them through the grief process.
              2. Just one, and they'll use a non-disposable diaper too!
              3. None: Cancerians would worry themselves to death with
                 the problem.
        How many Leos does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Leos don't change light bulbs, although sometimes their
                 agents get a Virgo in to do it for them while they're
                 out.
              2. None: Leos are so enthusiastic they carry their own
                 light.
        How many Virgos does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Virgos don't have time to change their own light bulbs.
                 They're too busy changing them for everyone else.
              2. Approximately 1.000000 with an error of +/- 1 millionth.
              3. Let's see: One to spot the bulb, one to record the time
                 the bulb burned out and the date it was bought, one to
                 decide who's fault it is the bulb burned out and ask why
                 that brand was chosen in the first place, ten to decide
                 to remodel the house as long as they're changing the
                 bulb...
        How many Libras does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Er, two. Or maybe one. No - on second thoughts, make
                 that two. Is that okay with you?
              2. Why change the bulb? Isn't it more romantic in the dark?
              3. Well gee, I don't know really. I guess it depends on the
                 bulb and where it burned out. It might perhaps take just
                 one if it's just an ordinary bulb, but maybe two if the
                 person doesn't know where to find a new light bulb,
                 or...
        How many Scorpios does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Why do you want to know? Are you a cop?
              2. None - they'd rather sit in the dark.
              3. That information is strictly secret and only shared with
                 the inner members of the heirarchical Order.
        How many Sagittarians does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Look, ask me when I get back from India, okay?
              2. The sun is shining, the day is young, we've got our
                 whole lives ahead of us, and you're inside worrying
                 about a stupid burned out light bulb?
              3. A whole bunch: I can only keep them in the room long
                 enough for them to give the bulb a quarter turn a piece.
        How many Capricorns does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. None. Capricorns can't afford new light bulbs - unless
                 they're a legitimate business expense.
              2. I don't waste my time with these childish jokes.
              3. None: Why should I bother? It's probably just going to
                 burn out again tomorrow anyway.
        How many Aquarians does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Well, you have to remember that everything is energy
                 so...
              2. A hundred, but they'll all be competing to be the one to
                 change the bulb and bring light to the world.
              3. Like, why don't you just get out of my face and stop
                 asking me to do all your work for you? I'm, like, really
                 totally sick and tired of you asking me questions.
        How many Pisceans does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Huh? The light's out?

              3. None: They concern themselves with inner light.
        How many Arians does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. None: Arians aren't afraid of the dark.
              2. Just the one. You want to make something of it, eh?
              3. Only one, but it takes a lot of light bulbs. (smash)

After many hours of extremely acrobatic and 
exhausting sex with a blonde he had just picked up, 
a man goes into the kitchen for some food to 
replenish his just-spent energy. He pours himself a 
glass of milk and right before drinking it, he realizes 
his manhood is still pretty hot, so he sticks it in the 
glass to cool it off. Just then the blonde walks in and 
says, "Oh, I always wondered how you refilled 
those."

58.

A blonde and a brunette were talking one day. The 
brunette said that her boyfriend had a slight 
dandruff problem but she gave him "Head and 
Shoulders" and it cleared it up. The blonde asked 
inquisitively, "How do you give shoulders?"

59.

How is a blonde like a.......

	Hairdryer? Turn her on and she starts to blow.

	Vaccum Cleaner? Turn her on and she starts to 
suck.

60.

Person 1: What's the difference between a blonde 
and garbage?

take it out.

61.

Did you hear what the blonde who was opening a 
new bar said when her lawyer explained to her that 
she needed a liquor license?

"Oh, it's not gonna be THAT kind of a bar. That's 
disgusting!"

62.

There was a blonde driving down the road 
listening to the radio. The announcer was telling 
blonde joke after blonde joke until the blonde was 
mad enough she turned her radio off. A mile down 
the road, she saw another blonde out in a corn field 
in a boat rowing. The blonde stopped her car jumped 
out and yelled, "You bimbo, it's blondes like you that 
give us all a bad name. If I could swim I'd come out 
there and give you what's coming to you!"

63. 

A dumb blonde was bragging about her 
knowledge of the state capitals (or for Bill Clinton 
capitols). She proudly said," go ahead, ask me, I 
know all of them."

A red head said, "O.K., what's the capital of 
Wisconsin?"

The blonde replied, "Oh, that's easy, 'W'."

64.

 A blonde was walking along, when she looked up 
to observe a bird flying overhead. Suddenly, the bird 
drops a load when it was directly over her. The 
blonde says, "Good thing I had my mouth open, or 
that would've hit me right in the face!!!" 

 Or: "Good thing that cows don't fly.

67.

A man walks into a bar, with a huge alligator on a 
leash. He walks over to the bar, and orders a beer. 
The bartender says "Sorry sir. You can't bring that 
alligator in here! It's a dangerous animal, and you're 
scaring all of the patrons! 

True enough, the man looked around, and noticed 
that everyone was standing on the tables, looking 
very nervous. "But wait!" he cried, "this alligator is 
tame! It wouldn't hurt anyone!". However, the 
bartender is adamant. "If", the man continues, "I can 
prove that this alligator is not vicious, can he stay?". 
"Well, I guess so", says the bartender, "however, 
you're going to have a devil of a time proving to 
everyone in here that that alligator is tame!" The man 
smiles, and leans over the alligator. 

"Ralph!", he shouts, "Sit up!" With that, he beats 
the alligator on the head with his fist "BANG BANG 
BANG". And the alligator rears up on its tail. 
"Ralph, open your mouth! BANG BANG BANG". 
And the alligator opened it's huge mouth wide, 
revealing row upon row of gleaming white teeth. 
The man pulls out his wang, and lays it in the 
alligators mouth, as the entire bar crowd gasps. 
"Ralph! Close your mouth, but DON'T BITE! BANG 
BANG BANG". As the man pummels the alligator 
on the head, the giant mouth slowley closes, and 
stops juuuussttt short of biting the guys dick off. 

The crowd sighs, and the man says "Ralph, open 
your mouth! BANG BANG BANG!" and the 
alligators mouth opens wide again. "There,"says the 
man to the crowd, " now would anyone else like to 
try this?" 

A blonde in the back says "Yeah, I'll try, but only if 
your promise not to hit me on the head so hard".

            Walden Galleria.
            Note: The Walden Galleria Mall, only an hour and a half away
            from the Centre of the Universe and just off the Interstate
            in Buffalo, New York, was the Mecca of Torontonians engaging
            in the old Canadian tradition of cross border shopping. On a
            weekend the parking lot would be so full of Ontario plates
            you would think that you were in Canada. Of course you could
            not legally return to Canada with more than $25 worth of
            goods for an afternoon visit and so thousands of honest,
            polite and industrious Canadians were turned into lowlife
            smugglers. The classic method for smuggling clothing was
            "wearing it back" and so long lines of cars containing
            scantily and poorly dressed Canadians would patiently queue
            up Sunday morning to cross into New York State and a few
            hours later, miraculously, in the true American tradition of
            rags to riches, be transformed into trendy and well attired
            Torontonians as they returned home satiated by an intensive
            afternoon of power shopping with nothing to declare to Canada
            Customs, leaving their rags behind to grace the dumpsters of
            the exotic malls of Williamsburg and Cheektawoga. This all
            ended with the introduction of Sunday shopping in Ontario in
            1992 and the steadily declining value of the Canadian dollar.
            Sorry I got so long winded, but Sunday in Buffalo was fun
            while it lasted, even if you got caught and this joke, lame
            as it is, brought back a lot of memories.
            
   How many Filipinoes does it take to screw in a light bulb?

   Helga, how many Germans does it take to change a light bulb ?
          Ah, is this the one about the highly-trained quality control
          checkers at the Lowenbrau brewery here in the beautiful city of
          Munich where they have to carefully check that each and every
          stage of the bier brewing process adheres to the Reinheitsgebot
          ancient brewing laws laid down in 1516 which set minimum
          standards for the purity of the ingredients otherwise they'd be
          subject to extremely enormous fines so quality control is a
          very important job both in terms of the quality of all the
          Lowenbrau biers and of course the financial good health of the
          company from the checking of the malted barley with the hops

         5. Four. One to design the change, one to implement it, one to
            document it, and one to maintain it afterwards.
         6. Four, plus one senior analyst to manage the project, one
            technical writer to correct the spelling and grammar of the
            one who documented it, one light bulb librarian, a
            sales-force of at least five to drum up enough users who want

         1. You're still thinking procedurally. A properly designed light
            bulb object would inherit a change method from a generic
            light bulb class, so all you'd have to do is send a light
            bulb change message.
         2. Only one, but it takes him all night, and when he's done, the
            refrigerator and toilet don't work.
         3. At least a dozen, but it's impossible to tell which one it
            is, because they're all pointing at each other going "That's
            me, over there !"

          400. 1 to change the bulb, 50 to write a magazine about it, 50

          when you hit the bulb it will announce all the names of the
          team involved, 50 to go down to the drinks machine and get

            Note: LISP is a recursive programming language. One problem
            LISP programmers have to contend with is infinite recursion.
            (cf computer dictionary entry: recursion - see recursion)
            These lisp heads are usually research AI types and their
            standard answer is as in the punchline. It could be improved:
         2. (((H)mmm,) (I'm ((not) sure, better))) (find (out))...

            problem.
            
   How long will it take?
          That's indeterminate. It depends on how many dead bulbs they've

            GC7500439-0001, Multitasking Incandescent Source System
            Facility, of which 10 percent of the pages state only "This page
            intentionally left blank", and 20 percent of the definitions are of

         2. Did you try rebooting with extensions off?
         3. Just one, but the new light bulbs aren't compatible with the
            old sockets, so he has to buy a complete upgrade or a new
            light.
         4. Two: One to ask the socket to eject the old bulb, and one to
            insert the new one.
         5. Three: One to change the bulb, one to copyright the method
            for changing the bulb, and one to call in the lawyers on
            anyone who infringes on the "look and feel" of the bulb
            changing method.

   How many Apple and IBM nuts does it take to change a light bulb?
          An infinite number: nothing useful gets done while they're
          arguing. Finally a disgusted generic computer user (who will
          use any type that is in front of him) gets up and changes the
          bulb, elbowing the participants aside. The size of the crowd
          arguing seems to be a function of time, although whether or not
          the function is exponential is not known.

          their Web browser for free, announcing that the final version
          will be free also. Once the final version was out, they changed
          their mind. Only for students, educators and employees of
          non-profit organisations does it remain free.

            soft white but you can use any 100-watt soft white as long as
            it's manufactured by DEC.
         2. "Errr... Well, I've got a patch that I could apply to it, but
            if you can just wait till next year, it'll all be fixed when

        In earlier work, Wiener [1] has shown that one mathematician can
            change a light bulb.
            If k mathematicians can change a light bulb, and if one more
            simply watches them do it, then k+1 mathematicians will have
            changed the light bulb.
            Therefore, by induction, for all n in the positive integers,
            n mathematicians can change a light bulb.

            Note: Someone has been asking this as a bonus question on
            statistics exam papers for quite a while. Judging from some
            of his own students' exam answers, it depends on whether the
            light bulb is negatively or positively screwed.

            in any time interval is independent of how long you've been
            waiting.

   How many quantum physicists does it take to change a light bulb?
          One. Two to do it, and one to renormalise the wave function.
          (Explanation - Renormalising the wave function is something
          that has to be done to a lot of quantum physics calculations to
          stop the answer being infinity and makes the answer always come
          out as one.)

   How many surgeons does it take to change a light bulb?
          
         1. None. They would wait for a suitable donor and do a filament
            transplant.
         2. Three. They'd also like to remove the socket as you aren't
            using it now.
            
   How many orthopedic surgeons does it take to change a light bulb?
          Why don't you just let us take out the socket? You aren't using

          glass into the bulb shape, one to coil the tungsten wire
          filament, one to clean up the metal base of the old bulb, one
          to operate the vacuum pump to get rid of the air in the bulb
          and one to apply the glue to seal the new bulb into the old
          base. The new bulb won't work, of course, but the whole process
          uses up a lot of expensive equipment and keeps several
          intelligent people happily employed doing something totally
          useless.
          
   How many emergency room technicians does it take to change a light
          bulb?

            decides whether to make it priority case. Job booked.
            Supervisor (4) decides whether it should be done individually
            or with other jobs. Order is placed in maintenance man's
            pigeonhole. Maintenance man (5) fills in ticket describing
            job. He picks up the parts needed. He goes to scene of faulty
            light bulb. He fits bulb or discovers he cannot mend light.
            He returns to department and reports back. He completes work
            ticket putting this in writing. Work ticket is checked by
            maintenance department to see whether order carried out. Then
            checked to see task completed in time set out under
            department guidelines. Ticket filed. Member of department (6)
            checks ticket against department work plan. Details go into

          PR people try to force reporters to work their stories by
          talking to the PR person. Alas, the PR person never actually
          knows anything... so he/she is always responding as in the

            a light bulb?
              1. The entire team! And they all get a semester's credit
                 for it!
              2. Just one, but he gets 3 hours of credit for it. (or the
                 Heisman, if Barry Switzer can get enough Alumni support
                 for it) Note: The Heisman is a trophy awarded to the
                 supposed best overall college football player each
                 season by the NY Athletic Club. Barry Switzer was
                 formerly the University of Oklahoma football coach, one
                 of the winningest ever. The joke relates to the fact
                 that the school's publicity department has as much, if
                 not more, to do with getting the Heisman than the
                 player's actual ability.
                 (Commentary from another American! Not exactly... OU has
                 had a few Heisman trophy winners, but only one of them
                 when Switzer was head coach (thus the joke's really not
                 that funny). Now if you changed it to Woody Hayes,
                 former head coach at coach at Ohio State, or Bo
                 Schembechler, former Michigan head coach, it might be
                 more humorous.)

            (Commentary from an American: Oh, please <groan> :-). I live
            in Buffalo, so it's a slightly sore subject. This relates to
            recent Super Bowls. The Broncos have been to four Super
            Bowls, and lost three by huge margins-"blowouts". Likewise
            the Bills, the pride and joy of our city, have lost the last
            three straight, the last two by overwhelming margins.)

                 minute, one to pretend to twist the new one in round and
                 round so far it almost breaks, and some guy in a black
                 and white stripey uniform whose function is never made

            pawns while all this action takes place on the other side of
            the board, and one to flash its lights, make lots of noise,

                 evolved over many years by small steps,
               o There must be no discrimination against dark bulbs in
                 any form, and means must be found for all dark bulbs to
                 take their place alongside light bulbs on a basis of

               o We affirm the right of all bulbs to screw into the

                 develop itself to its full electrical potential.

            first one.
            Notes on the previous 3: Chassidim (pronounced
            "hass-ee-deem"-it's Hebrew) are an orthodox Jewish sect. The
            jokes above refer to various further subsects and their
            peculiarities. The Lubavitchers, the most prevalent, are
            known for their belief that the Mossiach (Messiah) will be
            coming along soon. The Bratzlaver joke refers to the fact
            that they all revered their founder, the Rabbi Nachman, and
            since he died they haven't really replaced him, as nobody in
            the group feels capable of filling his shoes. The Satmar are
            very strict in their adherence to the sex-role distinctions
            prescribed by the Bible-in one area, they've been fighting
            with local authorities about school busing, because they
            believe that women should not be allowed to drive, and the
            school system employs a lot of women as bus drivers.

            None. You can do it yourself, dammit.
        How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
              1. That's not funny, abusive white male aggressor!!
              2. None. It's not the light bulb that needs changing.
              3. Who cares as long as one of 'em sucks my cock.
              4. "Hey man, screwing objectifies the LB"
              5. Two..............IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH
                 THAT?????!!!!???
              6. Two - one to change the bulb and one to write about how
                 it feels.
              7. Two - one to change it and one to threaten to do a
                 Lorena Bobbitt on any man who tries to interfere.
              8. Three - one to do it, the others to consider unscrewing
                 it before it's a third of the way in.
              9. Three - one to screw it in and two to talk about the
                 sexual implications.
             10. Five, four to try like men and fail miserably, one to
                 find a female electrician, settle for a man and picket
                 as he works.
             11. Seven. One to change the light bulb, three to protest
                 the offense committed by the light bulb in regards to
                 the socket, two to secretly wish they were the socket,
                 and one to secretly wish she was the light bulb.
             12. 11. 1 to change the light bulb and 10 to form a
                 survivors of darkness support group!
             13. Seventy. One to change it while the others make a 69.
             14. 100. One to change it, and 99 to wring their hands and
                 agonize about how oppressed the socket is.
             15. How old-fashioned. The other 99 are there to lobby
                 Congress to outlaw crimes against sockets -- and to say
                 the bulb-changer is not a representative of mainstream
                 feminism.
             16. 50,000 marching on Ottawa (or Washington) demanding the
                 LB be changed!
             17. That depends. If there is money in it, it takes 10
                 women-only-government- contractors working 2 years at a
                 salary of $50,000 per year. Otherwise, it's
                 traditionally expected for the man to do it.
             18. Ten: To form a university funded protest committee to
                 research how the white male patriarchy conspires to keep
                 women and minorities in the dark.
             19. Two. One to threaten that as a mother, she will be
                 unable to provide her children light without federal
                 assistance; and a N.O.W. attorney to ask the Justice
                 Department to sue GE for allowing the bulb to go out in
                 the first place.
             20. Nobody knows. But everyone knows that women and
                 minorities will suffer more than anyone else because
                 it's dark.
             21. None. Women have a supreme court, constitionally
                 protected right to work in the dark if they choose to.
             22. It's sexual harassment to even SUGGEST jokingly on the
                 net that a woman SCREW in anything. This posting will be
                 banned by the FCC.
             23. One. But if the bulb IS replaced, the job will go to a
                 minority or woman contractor.
             24. 30,000 to start a letter writing campaign protesting
                 Newt Gingrich cutting off funds for the Federal Light
                 Bulb Changing Agency...
             25. Three. One to screw it in, and two to file a sexual
                 harassment lawsuit on behalf of the bulb.
             26. Two. One to wait for a federal agency to send someone to
                 screw it in. Another to file harassment charges against
                 the men possibly looking at her in the dark.
             27. Feminists don't screw at all. That's what sperm banks
                 are for!
             28. If a feminist does screw in a light bulb, it will be up
                 to the government or the father to support any children
                 resulting from such a sexual act. She will also require
                 free day care for the light bulb children and federal
                 funding for studies of how light-bulb children should be
                 treated under affirmative action hiring quotas.
             29. Unknown. But the federal government's welfare reform
                 will limit the number of free light bulbs a woman can
                 receive to under 2 years supply.
             30. One. But if she was a WHITE MALE (like Donald Trump),
                 she would be able to replace the light bulb much easier.
             31. One. And when she replaces it, she will think of Mother
                 Earth and use a fluorescent lamp designed to last 3
                 times longer and protect the environment... But if a man
                 isn't paying for it, then she will use the cheapest one.
             32. Two, one to change it and one to tell her she did a
                 really good job.

                 telling the light bulb that if it really wants to be

              1. "Are you sure you want to go to red alert Sir? It does
                 mean changing the bulb!"
              2. 7. Scotty will report to Captain Kirk that the light
                 bulb in the Engineering Section is burnt out, to which
                 Kirk will send Bones to pronounce the bulb dead. Scotty,
                 after checking around, notices that they have no more
                 new light bulbs, and complains that he can't see in the
                 dark to tend to his engines. Kirk must make an emergency
                 stop at the next uncharted planet, Alpha Regula IV, to
                 procure a light bulb from the natives. Kirk, Spock,
                 Bones, Sulu, and 3 red shirt security officers beam
                 down. The 3 security officers are promptly killed by the
                 natives, and the rest of the landing party is captured.
                 Meanwhile, back in orbit, Scotty notices a Klingon ship
                 approaching and must warp out of orbit to escape
                 detection. Bones cures the native king who is suffering
                 from the flu, and as a reward the landing party is set
                 free and given all of the light bulbs they can carry.
                 Scotty cripples the Klingon ship and warps back to the
                 planet just in time to beam up Kirk et. al. The new bulb
                 is inserted, and the Enterprise continues with its five
                 year mission.

                    We need help. We're three blondes changing a light
                    bulb.
             Operator:
                    Hmmmmm. You put in a fresh bulb?
             Blonde:
                    Yes.
             Operator:
                    The power in the house in on?
             Blonde:
                    Of course.
             Operator:
                    And the switch is on?
             Blonde:
                    Yes, yes.
             Operator:
                    And the bulb still won't light up?
             Blonde:
                    No, it's working fine.
             Operator:
                    Then what's the problem?
             Blonde:
                    We got dizzy spinning the ladder around and we all
                    fell and hurt ourselves.
        How many congressmen does it take to change a light bulb?
            Five hundred and thirty-five, but only if the following
            conditions are met: The light bulb will not be changed in an
            election year. A committee will study the light-bulb
            situation for at least a year. Taxes will have to be raised.
            A fair and proportionate number of the light-bulb changers
            will be from minority groups. No Social Security funds will
            be used to change the bulb. Each state and congressional
            district will share in the benefits of changing the light
            bulb. The blame for the failure of the present bulb will be
            assigned to the other party. The new bulb will be twice as
            bright as the old bulb. Because the new bulb is twice as
            bright as the old bulb, it will cost 130 times as much. A
            Blue Ribbon Panel will investigate the light-bulb failures
            and issue a mega-page report to the congress. A fact-finding
            trip to all countries known to produce light bulbs will be
            made by most congressmen and their wives. The CIA will
            investigate the Russian light-bulb-changing system. Details
            of the Russian light-bulb-changing system will be sold to the
            Chinese by an American naval officer. The surgeon general
            will issue a report about the perils of over-bright light
            bulbs. A program to supply light bulbs to those who cannot
            afford them will be introduced by Tip O'Neill. President
            Reagan will give a speech extolling the virtues of kerosene
            lanterns. Tip O'Neall will initiate a program of free
            kerosene for the needy. And finally, each and every
            congressman will send every one of his constituents a
            newsletter describing how he managed to get the light bulb
            changed almost single-handedly.
        How many lawyers does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. It only takes one lawyer to change your light bulb to

                 Now, if you're looking for a lawyer to screw a light
                 bulb...
              3. Whereas the party of the first part, also known as
                 "Lawyer", and the party of the second part, also known
                 as "Light Bulb", do hereby and forthwith agree to a
                 transaction wherein the party of the second part (Light
                 Bulb) shall be removed from the current position as a
                 result of failure to perform previously agreed upon
                 duties, i. E., the lighting, elucidation, and otherwise
                 illumination of the area ranging from the front (north)
                 door, through the entryway, terminating at an area just
                 inside the primary living area, demarcated by the
                 beginning of the carpet, any spillover illumination
                 being at the option of the party of the second part
                 (Light Bulb) and not required by the aforementioned
                 agreement between the parties. The aforementioned
                 removal transaction shall include, but not be limited
                 to, the following steps:
                   1. The party of the first part (Lawyer) shall, with or
                      without elevation at his option, by means of a
                      chair, stepstool, ladder or any other means of
                      elevation, grasp the party of the second part
                      (Light Bulb) and rotate the party of the second
                      part (Light Bulb) in a counter-clockwise direction,
                      this point being non-negotiable.
                   2. Upon reaching a point where the party of the second
                      part (Light Bulb) becomes separated from the party
                      of the third part ("Receptacle"), the party of the
                      first part (Lawyer) shall have the option of
                      disposing of the party of the second part (Light
                      Bulb) in a manner consistent with all applicable
                      state, local and federal statutes.
                   3. Once separation and disposal have been achieved,
                      the party of the first part (Lawyer) shall have the
                      option of beginning installation of the party of
                      the fourth part ("New Light Bulb"). This
                      installation shall occur in a manner consistent
                      with the reverse of the procedures described in
                      step one of this self-same document, being careful
                      to note that the rotation should occur in a
                      clockwise direction, this point also being
                      non-negotiable.
             NOTE: The above described steps may be performed, at the
                 option of the party of the first part (Lawyer), by any
                 or all persons authorized by him, the objective being to
                 produce the most possible revenue for the party of the
                 fifth part, also known as "Partnership."
        How many workers at Rocky Flats, the former nuclear weapon
            components plant in Golden, Colo., should it take to change a
            light bulb?
            Sixteen--and that's no joke:
            
            An internal memo written by a manager at the U.S. Department
            of Energy plant recommended a new safety procedure for "the
            replacement of a light bulb in a criticality beacon." The
            beacon, similar to the revolving red lamp atop a police car,
            warns workers of nuclear accidents. The memo said the job
            should take at least 16 people over 60 hours to replace the
            light. It added that the same job used to take 12 workers
            4.15 hours.
            
            The memo called for a planner to meet with six others at a
            work-control meeting; talk with other workers who have done
            the job before; meet again; get signatures from five people
            at that work-control meeting; get the project plans approved
            by separate officials overseeing safety, logistics, waste
            management and plant scheduling; wait for a monthly
            criticality-beacon test; direct electricians to replace the
            bulb; and then test and verify the repair. Mark Obmascik in
            Denver Post (reprinted in Reader's Digest)

            It's "Radcliffe Women" and it's not funny!
            Note: Radcliffe is the all-women's college near Harvard that
            used to be where women went before Harvard went co-ed. Since
            then it has earned a reputation for militant feminism as it
            has remained all-female. The joke is on feminists' supposed
            failure to laugh along at deprecatory remarks.

        How many cabbage patch dolls does it take to change a light bulb?

            even if you knew how many.
            Note: Topical to 1983 and the difficulty of obtaining cabbage

                 various possible meanings of each phrase, word, and
                 syllable; nine columnists to write about it from
                 radically different viewpoints; eight letter writers to
                 respond vehemently with opposing points of view; seven
                 Quibblers who delight in pointing out others' mistakes
                 (what is said is not as important as saying it
                 correctly); six conservatives who believe things should
                 stay the way they are; five liberals who believe that
                 action should be taken immediately to form a committee
                 to study possible actions; four ornery SOBs who disagree
                 on principal with anything anyone else has suggested;
                 three peacemakers who believe it's more important to
                 work it out without showing any more emotions than
                 necessary to get it done; two statisticians who maintain
                 that numbers are more important than facts; and one
                 pragmatist to ignore the BS and replace the bad bulb
                 with a good one. Whilst all this is going on, all the
                 Mensans are keeping count in their heads just to make
                 absolutely sure that it really does add up to 66.
        How many light bulbs does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. One, if it knows its own Goedel number.
                 Note: A Goedel Number is one of several ways to encode a
                 Turing Machine, the classical abstraction of a computer,
                 or for that matter of any algorithm. The idea (as best I
                 see it) is that if the machine knows its own Goedel
                 Number it can simulate itself... It does come from the
                 mathematician Goedel - partly because he used TMs in his
                 famous theorem, I believe.
              2. Two, the new one and the old one. (hahahahah ???)
        How many dadaists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            To get to the other side.
        How many Democratic presidential candidates from 1988 did it take
            to screw in a light bulb?
              1. (Mike Dukakis) In Massachusetts, my enlightened
                 government has made it unnecessary for people to screw
                 in their own light bulbs, as we have put thousands of
                 former welfare recipients to work for the Dept. of Light
                 Bulb Installation. These employees will come to your
                 home or business and install any incandescent bulb, on
                 only a few months notice.
              2. (Bruce Babbitt) It's foolish to talk about screwing in
                 light bulbs when we haven't even taken the first step,
                 and that is to remove the old bulb. I challenge my
                 fellow candidates to stand up with me and help me remove
                 this old light bulb [stands, but nobody else does] Hah!
                 What wimps. You guys make Bush look like Rambo.
              3. (Richard Gephart) It doesn't matter whether the bulb is
                 changed or not; it only matters that the new bulb was
                 made in the US of A. Taiwan and South Korea have put up
                 massive barriers to importing US light bulbs; we'll see
                 how they like it when their bulbs cost $10,000 to screw
                 in here.
              4. (Gary Hart) This oblique reference to screwing is an
                 obvious attempt to drag my personal life into this
                 campaign. Frankly, I resent it, and the American people
                 resent it.
              5. (Al Gore) As usual, the other left-wing wacko candidates
                 are putting forth solutions that moderate Southerners
                 won't cotton to on Super Tuesday. At least I hope not.
              6. (Paul Simon) My media experts tell me I'm foolish for
                 wearing my hair the same way I did in the 50's. But
                 that's what Paul Simon's all about. And I suppose my
                 media experts are gonna say I'm foolish for this, but in
                 all candor, I change my light bulbs the same way I did
                 in the 50's: my wife gets on a ladder and I turn it.
              7. (Jesse Jackson) Changing the light bulb is a partial
                 solution at best. I'm more of a Lone Ranger than a light
                 bulb changer. But even the Lone Ranger had Tonto and
                 Silver, and the shameful fact is that the American
                 Indians of today don't have enough silver, or gold, or
                 even paper money to allow them to buy into the American
                 Dream or some extra light bulbs. We must ensure that all
                 Americans can light their homes, from the lighthouse to
                 the White House.
        How many Republican Presidential candidates from 1988 did it take
            to change a light bulb?
              1. (Dole) When I was a poor boy growing up in Kansas we
                 didn't have light bulbs. Now I have the housekeeper do
                 it.
              2. (DuPont) Light bulbs need to be changed? Gosh. I guess
                 the servants have always taken care of that... With a
                 DuPont administration, the power of the free market will
                 be unleashed to produce light bulbs that never need
                 changing.
              3. (Robertson) Oh, Lord, with thy divine illumination, heal
                 this light bulb!
              4. (Kemp) It's morning in America! Why should we worry
                 about light bulbs? Let those doom-crying Democrats worry
                 about light bulbs! [stumble over chair in the dark].
              5. (Haig) One. Snap to it, soldier!
              6. (Bush) None. (Bush in an earnest lap dog voice) I resent
                 that question. I've answered it before, and I think the
                 media are keeping this thing alive. I think the American
                 people are TIRED of light bulb jokes.
        How many Kennedy assassination conspiracy theorists does it take
            to screw in a light bulb?
            15-One to screw it in, five to say he acted alone, one to say
            that someone hidden in the ceiling helped, one to film it,
            one to do an intense examination of the film and conclude
            that a) it was tampered with and b) it proves that the first
            screwer did not act alone, one to insist that the bulb was
            altered after it was unscrewed, three tramps to walk across
            the room an hour later, one to insist LBJ really screwed the
            bulb in, and one to accuse all the others of being
            disinformation specialists.
        How many election canvassers does it take to change a light bulb?
            
            None. They'd just go round telling everyone that it's time
            for a change but the only way this can come about is if
            everyone votes for "New light bulb."
        How many Russians does it take to change a light bulb?
            That's a military secret.
        How many military information officers does it take to change a
            light bulb?
            At the present point in time it is against policy and the
            best interests of military strategy to divulge information of
            such a statistical nature. Next question, please.
        How many American Imperialist Pigs does it take to screw in a
            light bulb?
            Three - one to put in the bulb, and two to search through the
            cartons of inferior American produced light bulbs for one
            that isn't defective.
            Note: Probably the Eastern European equivalent of an ethnic
            joke.
        How many Sparts does it take to change a light bulb?
            You can't CHANGE a light bulb!
            Note: Sparts = Spartacus Youth League, a leftist fringe group
            that believes in violent revolution. Attributed to Michael
            Anderson '83, a student activist at Harvard.

            One, but the bulb has to be changed constantly.
        How many anarchists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            All of them.
            Note: An anarchic society has no one in charge; each must do
            for theirself. Perhaps it would help to say, "All of them.
            Or, none of them. Or several." (BTW, I prefer "theirself" to
            any other construction.)
        How many British navy Officers does it take to change a light

            hold his crack pipe while he does it.

            Only one, but they keep changing it back and forth between

            a hyphen.)
        How many smokers does it take to change a light bulb?

        How many preservation society members does it take to screw in a

            Two thirds.

                 anything wrong with it, one to accuse its owners of
                 mistreating it, one to find somewhere else to screw it
                 in for the next 6 months, and one to eventually bring it
                 back and say it was all done with the light bulb's best
                 interests at heart.
              2. Four. One to change the bulb, one to counsel the old

                 make sure they are all following the correct working

              3. One, to be dying of cancer and request that everybody
                 around the world send him light bulbs so he can get into
                 the Guinness Book of World Records.
              4. One, who'll do it for food.
              5. One, to have a drink with a strange woman in a bar and
                 pass out, wake up three days later in a seedy hotel
                 room, find a scar on his back, and realize where the
                 light bulb went.
              6. Derek Tearne, to confirm that the bulb turns the same
                 way in the southern hemisphere in spite of the Coriolis
                 Effect (which is actually pretty negligible).
              7. Furrfu ! Note: - furrfu is the word "sheesh" encoded in
                 Rot-13 (a simple but commonly-used cipher that helps
                 protect the unwary against unwanted exposure to sexual,
                 vulgar, or other offensive language).
        How many alt.conspiracy readers does it take to screw in a light
            bulb?
            One to do it, one to insist that the CIA was responsible for
            the old bulb burning out, one to blame it on the Illuminati,
            one to blame the TLC/CFR/Bilderberg group, and Steve Crocker
            to say that Lyndon LaRouche predicted the bulb would someday
            burn out whereas the British-dominated establishment was
            telling us the bulbs would never need to be replaced, Ted
            Frank to tell everyone they're full of it, and several other
            people to insist that Ted is a member of the CFR.
        How many net.jokers does it take to tell yet-another light bulb
            joke?
            622 - One to tell the original joke, and the rest to give
            some minor variation of it, believing this to constitute a
            great new joke that noone else had ever thought of.
        How many net.poets does it take to change a light bulb?

               swimming
None, fish are          through the       of my conciousness,

            One. But he's gotta cross-post it all over the goddam place.
        How many USENET users does it take to screw in a ligth bulb?
              1. Six. One to point out the spelling (you illiterate
                 idiot!), one to flame: GET THIS GARBAGE OFF THE NET!!!,
                 one to flame the flamer, one to ask to be removed from
                 the news group, one to ask for a copy of the last
                 message :-) , and one to ask how to unROT the joke.
              2. Fifty - One to do it and 49 to talk about it on
                 net.bulbs.d.
                 Note: a nice try, but there's no such group.
                 alt.fan.lightbulbs is quite active, though - BRIAN.
        How many rec.humor.funny readers does it take to screw in a light
            bulb?
            50. They all stand out in the hall while Maddi comes out
            every once in a while and looks at all the light bulbs people
            have brought. Finally she selects a few. They're all quite
            feeble and burn out after a few minutes, so she comes out for
            more. But she selects more dim bulbs, which causes great
            discontent among the people who have brought really bright,
            long-lasting bulbs.
        How many rec.humour posters does it take to change a light bulb ?
            
            31. One to change the light bulb and thirty to flame them for
            picking the wrong wattage. No, better make that 32 ...
            Captain Nitpick will want to point out that the newsgroup is
            rec.humor (US spelling) not rec.humour.
        How many rec.humor readers does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. 100-one to announce that it burned out, 10 to agree, 20
                 to come running in with new light bulbs and screw them
                 in, 9 to screw them in and leave the old bulb in, 10 to
                 ask for a videotape of the screwing, another one to come
                 in a few minutes later and notice the bulb went out
                 again and start the whole process all over again. And
                 one (me!) to notice that this doesn't actually add up to
                 100.
              2. 1000. And they change the same bulb over and over and
                 over again and still no one notices it's been changed so
                 they change it again and again and then they even
                 discuss it and then someone flames them for not doing it
                 in rec.humor.d.
              3. 565. 1 to put in a trick bulb (say, a flash bulb), 6 to
                 flame the first, pointing out that this bulb is
                 different from the old one, 29 to counter-flame,
                 pointing out that the new bulb is deliberately
                 different, and is parodying the old one, 7 to leave the
                 room, citing the extreme density of the 6, 12 to demand
                 that this commentary be redirected to the other room, 14
                 to ask that the bulb be changed again, since they missed
                 seeing it the first time, and 496 (a bit excessive, but
                 it's not my joke) to climb all over each other, trying
                 to put the old bulb back in.
              4. An infinitely growing number : - One to announce that
                 the bulb burned out. Ten to agree. One to change it, one
                 to post in saying "I got it", one to post in saying
                 "Yes, but they have shots for it nowadays", one to post
                 in saying "Our news software hasn't been working and I
                 missed the original light bulb joke. Would someone
                 please post it again or email it to me?", one to post in
                 quoting everything so far and the words "Me too", two to
                 turn it into a cascade, another ten to build the cascade
                 into a disk-wasting monster, one to post in with "I
                 don't get it. Isn't this the place for FUNNY jokes?",
                 one to post in after two months "What's this light bulb
                 joke you're all talking about?", one to repost it a
                 month later thinking it's a new joke, one to post "I
                 didn't get it. What's the punchline?", one to post "Has
                 anyone got a list of these? I'm starting a list, so
                 please send me all your light bulb jokes", and one to
                 cross-post the joke to alt.fan.lightbulbs 6 months later
                 prefixed by "Are we allowed to tell jokes in here?" and
                 accompanied by all of our old favourites like "How many
                 programmers...? None that's a hardware problem.", three
                 to ask, a month later, "What FTP sites are the old light
                 bulbs archived at?", and any number to revive the entire
                 exchange at stochastic intervals of two to six months.
        How many alt.fan.pratchett readers does it take to change a light
            bulb?
            Four. One to actually change the bulb, one to write amusing
            footnotes about it, one to propose to Laura, and a newbie to
            ask if that's really THE Terry Or colette or both, and then
            to realise that the speed of light can't be measured, except
            in badgers, or possibly multiple of pi, then to say sod it
            and ask if anyone knows where to find the lyrics for the
            hedgehog song...

            NuclEAR WArHead!!
        How many Nitpicks does it take to change a light bulb?
            None. They just let someone else change it, then they point

        How many EXPLAINORs does it take to change a light bulb?
            None, because The KILLOR killed him!

            rec.humor group.)
        How many AOL users does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Two. One to screw in the light bulb, and one to watch
                 him to make sure he doesn't say 'nipple'.
              2. Eight. One screws in the light bulb, but seven more do
                 too, due to a software bug.
              3. Eleven. One to ask to be on the light bulb gif mailing
                 list, nine to say "ME TOO!", and another to post a
                 message asking for the intructions on how to view a
                 light bulb.
                 Note: If you don't beleive me, see the
                 alt.binaries.pictures.supermodels,
                 alt.binaries.pictures.celebreties, and alt.sex
                 newsgroups and you will see threads up to 10 "ME TOO!"s
                 long consisting of all AOL'ers requesting to be put on
                 non exisitent .gif/ftp mailing lists. Internet folklore
                 tells us that all the gits are on AOL. The software
                 they're using is only partly to blame.
        How many VEGAN-L subscribers does it take to change a light bulb?
            
            Most of them. One to change it and post a little joke about
            it to the list, one to post in saying "I got it", one to post
            in saying "Yes, but they have herbal remedies for it
            nowadays", one to post "And homeopathic ones too, I read
            somewhere", one to post in saying he accidentally deleted the
            original light bulb joke and could someone please post it
            again or email it to him, one to post in quoting everything
            so far and the words "Me too", two to turn it into a cascade,
            one to post "What's this light bulb joke you're all talking
            about then?", one to post "I dunno, it sounds like some kind
            of food", one to post "In that case, has anyone got a recipe
            for one then?", one to post in requesting Michael Traub look
            up and tell us all its B12 content, one to post "Will it help
            cure my auntie's arthritis?", one to assert that it probably
            won't, but its effectiveness at this might well be increased
            by accompanying it with some shiatsu and meditation, two to
            condemn that as too unscientific, one to ask whether light
            bulbs are totally vegan, one to post "Read the FAQ", one
            assert that they are and add "I like light bulbs. They're low
            in fat, and stay crunchy in soya milk too !", one to announce
            that she's leaving the list unless the discussion gets a bit
            more meaningful, three to post in reassuring her that
            eventually it will, Lissa Mosley to post that the list
            moderators feel they must respectfully request that the
            discussion be moved to private email as it has been going on
            far too long, one to agree with this and add "So what has all
            this got to do with ethical veg*nism anyway?" and suggest the
            discussion be moved to alt.fan.lightbulbs , and one to post
            in quoting this suggestion and add "What's that?". So the
            discussion moves to usenet, as our intrepid vegan-l
            subscribers venture beyond the boundaries of email, and
            alt.fan.lightbulbs finds itself taking a few days off from
            the "My incredible light" and "Light Bulb death" discussions
            and come up with some new jokes...
        How many alt.sex.stories readers does it take to change a light
            bulb?
            Cindy fondled the burnt-out bulb whilst beads of sweat
            glistened on her perfectly rounded breast... Her brother
            Billy had gone to the hardware store to get a new light bulb.
            Suddenly the door opened and there he stood, silhouetted
            against the sharp light from the doorway. She could see the
            bulge in his pants.. "They didn't have any light bulbs but
            wait'll you get a load of my hardware", he said as he started
            unzipping his pants...
        How many uk.singles readers does it take to change a light bulb?
            Most of them. One female to notice that it had gone out and
            post something about how light bulbs are so masculine to the
            group, two to post in disagreeing with this, Susan Macran to
            post "Bog off stumpy!", a whole terminal room in Keele to sit
            there discussing it only among themselves, one to post a
            coherent critique of Susan Macran's last post, Kate Smith to
            complain that the women always get flamed more than the men,
            Menya to say that light bulbs are sexy as long as they're
            orange and could someone bring her a nice hot one, and two
            people to post in suggesting a boink so they can all get
            together and change the light bulb, with real friendship and
            good lighting not relationships uppermost in their minds.
            During all this time, not one person dares risk losing points
            by posting a personals ad.
        How many alt.pagan.* group readers does it take to change a light
            bulb
              1. None. Torches are more traditional.
              2. 23. One to change the bulb and 22 to argue how their
                 family tradition regarding light bulbs is more justified
                 and ancient than anyone else's.
        How many IRC chatters does it take to change a light bulb?
            None. They're so busy saying hello, goodbye, and kicking each
            other off that noone ever has enough time to get anything
            done !
        How many humor theorists does it take to submit a light bulb
            joke?
            300 - one to change the bulb and 299 to analyze it to death.
        How many netters does it take to submit a light bulb joke?
              1. 1000 - One to invent the joke and 999 to submit "How
                 many programmers does it take to screw in a light bulb?
                 None, that's a hardware problem."
              2. 2, 1 to do it and 1 to read this huge file first to
                 check it hasn't been done already!
        How many light bulb jokes does it take to change a light bulb
            joke?
            Hmmmm - the probability that a given light bulb joke will be
            submitted to the net in any given week is .4, and the
            probability that it will have changed detectably since the
            last transmission is .2 . Hence (assuming independence, which
            is reasonable since no submitter of a light bulb joke ever
            seems to know it has been submitted before, within the last 2
            or 3 weeks), the probability that it will change in a given
            week is .08. So it takes about 12.5 light bulb jokes to
            change a light bulb joke.

              1. Two. One to hold the giraffe and the other to fill the

              2. Two. One to change it and one to throw a bucket of water
                 out the window. (An interesting story about this joke -
                 it was once being told at a party or something, and the
                 person being asked correctly made up a completely
                 irrelevant answer, and was promptly corrected by a loud
                 chorus of "No, it's a fish !")

            surrealist.

            glue light bulbs to a cocker spaniel, and one to put a bulb
            in the socket and fill the room with light while all the
            critics and buyers are watching the fellow smashing the bulbs
            against the wall, the fellow with the spray-gun, and the
            cocker spaniel. (what goes clink-clink-clink, ow-woooo?)
        How many sado-masochists does it take to change a light bulb?

        How many computer security experts does it take to change a light

            "That depends on the TCSEC rating of the object light bulb.
            If it's a C2 bulb (or below), one. If a B1 bulb, just one,
            but he/she must document the potential covert channel. If a
            B2 bulb, he/she must also audit the covert channel. If a
            B3/A1 bulb, none, since covert channels are not allowed. [See
            also the "Orange Book"]
        How many Systems Assurance testers does it take to change a light

        How many SAS programmers does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. How many?
              2. It depends : - If they are applications programmers, it
                 takes exactly twice as many as are currently available.
                 If they are host programmers, it takes one for each
                 variant of Unix and/or MicroSoft Windows. If they are
                 core programmers, it only takes one. He just holds the
                 bulb to the socket and waits for the world to revolve
                 around him.
              3. One to analyze the historical failure rates of light
                 bulbs using PROC LIFEREG, so as to anticipate the
                 failure of the light bulb before the user actually has
                 to report it, one to explain why SAS is better for
                 changing light bulbs than S-Plus, SPSS/X, BMDP, SYSTAT,
                 MINITAB or a spreadsheet, one to write a custom
                 interface in AF/SCL allowing the user to manually
                 request the changing of the light bulb after its failure
                 (prematurely) occurs, one to write a report with PROC
                 SQL and PROC REPORT which will summarize the light bulbs
                 needing to be changed, sorted twelve different ways,
                 cross-indexed (by wattage, type, and
                 prematureness-of-failure) and totaled, one to actually
                 spin the light bulb into the socket using SAS/Insight,
                 one to call Cary to try to get them to explain when a
                 new version of the light bulb will ship, how much we'll
                 pay to keep using light bulbs for another year, and what
                 we'll do if our site sends all its light bulbs to Europe
                 where 120V/60Hz light bulbs tend to explode upon
                 insertion in 220V/50Hz circuits, one to write an
                 incomprehensible ten line SAS macro program which will
                 perpetually insert new filaments into all mission
                 critical light bulbs until its author is fired, at which
                 point the SAS macro will automatically encode itself
                 into a copy of the latest SAS/ETS usage notes, one to
                 write a graphical front end to the light bulb changing
                 process using SAS/EIS, with little speedometers showing
                 the number of light bulbs changed per hour, so that
                 management can understand why we need to buy bigger
                 light bulbs, one to prepare a SUGI paper summarizing the
                 entire light bulb project, taking credit for the design
                 and execution of the light bulb project itself as well
                 as the invention of the light bulb itself, another one
                 to prepare a second SUGI paper benchmarking light bulb
                 replacement on twelve different types of light sockets,
                 with separate graphs for florescent and incandescent
                 bulbs (made with SAS/Graph, except for the titling,
                 axes, color, polylines, and background, which were all
                 added manually with Cricket Graph on a Mac), ten to push
                 the dollie loaded with SAS/Light Bulb manuals, and, One
                 more to ask SAS-L for help when you really need to
                 change that bulb, now.
              4. Zero. We have the housekeeping staff do it for us.
              5. Please let us know!
              6. That depends; what color is the bulb?
              7. It all depends on whether they can read the manuals or
                 not. That needs to be in there somewhere as a qualifier!
              8. They can't change light bulbs... Without light, they
                 can't read the manual, and without the manual, they
                 can't figure out how to change the light bulb.
              9. This can not be computed. Changing light bulbs is a
                 hardware problem...
             10. Two. One to change the light bulb and one to make sure
                 the stack of manuals doesn't tip over.
             11. One, once the documentation for the procedure is found
                 in one of the 15 manuals on the shelf.
             12. Well, it depends upon the platform on which one stands!
             13. Actually none, if you are willing to close your eyes to
                 the (validity of the) output.
             14. It can't be done yet. "Light bulb" is more than 8
                 characters long.
        How many APL hackers does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            None. There's a primitive for that.
            Note: I don't do APL but I think a primitive is a procedure
            that is included as a part of the language. You don't have to
            write code ("hack") to do it.

                 about the exact problem?..."
              2. I'm sorry, we don't support that kind of lighting
                 technology.

            have? Ok. Now, exactly how dark is it? Ok, there could be
            four or five things wrong . . . have you tried the light
            switch?

            light bulb?
            Dammit, why do they have to keep changing it ? Every bloody
            week. You'd've thought they'd have learnt by now, if it's not
            broken they shouldn't bugger about with it. What's that ? It
            WAS broken this time you say ? Blush

            bulb.

              2. One, it only takes one person to use a hammer.
              3. Three, one to change the bulb, one to take care of the

                 tending to the sheep's needs.

            Four. Two to trot merrily down to the shops to buy a new one,
            of whom person 1 then rips it unceremoniously out of its
            packaging and person 2 starts to do the changing, and the 2

            bulb?
            None. That's a tech job.
            Note: That joke is a lot funnier if you know a little bit
            about the wonderful world of commercial radio. Suffice it to
            say that it is a highly unionized environment, and there is
            always a little friendly (?) bickering between the
            technicians and the jocks. :-)

            moving harmony...
        How many crusties does it take to change a light bulb?
            Twelve. Crusty #1 yanks the old bulb out and crusty #2 is
            just about to put the new one in when crusties #3 and #4
            stagger in and start arguing that it's their turn. In the
            ensuing squabble the bulb gets dropped on the floor and
            smashes. Then crusty #5 points out what a good laugh this is
            and so chief crusty (#6) dispatches crusties #7 and #8 to go
            down the shops to buy a new one. After having visited at
            least 2 off licences on the way, they find their way into the
            hardware shop. While crusty #7 is busily trying to buy 6 new
            bulbs for the princely sum of 10p each and a can of special
            brew, crusty #8 is busy liberating as many as will fit into
            his long grey shapeless overcoat's pockets. They are joined
            on the way back by crusties #9 and #10 whose names they've
            forgotten but they do at least sound familiar, and much
            frivolous hugging ensues until someone remembers what the
            trip down the shops was all about. On their way back into the
            squat they pass crusty #11, who has only just joined the
            group, and who is just on his way out to go and get his hair
            crimped. Anyway once inside, the light bulbs are all smashed
            on the floor and the stereo is cranked up so the dancing can
            begin. At this point crusty #12 comes back in from a
            Levellers gig and collapses in a corner, only to find he is
            lying on something that makes a noise, which turns out to be
            the dog, holding the last unsmashed light bulb in its mouth.

            health or philosophical reasons?)

            Two. One to change it and one to get out a copy of The

            that the manufacturer (Thorn Lighting) is part of Thorn EMI
            who are involved in (blah blah blah...)

              2. Eleven. One to remove the old one and ten to stand
                 around discussing what they all want to do next.

            #2 notices that it has been imported from Britain and
            promptly sets fire to it, so farmer #1 has to go and get

            screw in a LIGHT BULB.
              1. None, they wouldn't have noticed it needed changing.
                 Even if they did they'd get someone else to do it.
              2. One, but he'll be too busy touting the superiority of
                 the soft white variety over all others.
        How many racists does it take to change a light bulb?
            The question is irrelevant since you can never find anyone
            that admits to being a racist even if you knew how many you

            Sloane Rangers, but most people didn't seem to have a clue
            what that meant so I changed it.)
        How many politically correct people does it take to change a
            light bulb?
            None. "Why should we impose our values on the light bulb? If

        How many blind people does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. It depends whether the switch is on or off.

                 number, until one of them figures out to turn it off.
        How many deaf blind people does it take to change a light bulb?

            <Ahem> We do not discuss this with ladies and children
            present.
        How many BATF agents does it take to screw in a light bulb?
              1. Four hundred to attempt to seize the old bulb and then
                 surround the house when it rebuffs them.
              2. It doesn't matter, they just burn down the house.
        Note: BATF is The US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms,
            repsonsible for setting up that Waco (We Aint Coming Out !)
            Branch Davidians siege in spring 1993, which ended in a
            fashion the second punchline suggests.
        How many xxxxxxx (fill in the blank: FBI agents, narcs, deans)
            does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            Six. One to seize the light bulb and the others hold him very
            very still, because they KNOW the world turns.
            (Someone please explain this one ! Surely it's not the same
            joke as egotists?)
        How many Supreme Court Justices does it take to screw in a light
            bulb?
            Nine-three to form a plurality, two to concur in part, two to
            dissent one to concur in part and dissent in part with the
            plurality opinion, and the last to concur with the dissenters
            in part.
        How many Hegelians does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            Two, of course. One stands at one end of the room and argues
            that it isn't dark; the other stands across from him and says
            that true light is impossible. This dialectic creates a
            synthesis when the bulb gets screwed in.
            Note: Hegel and Marx use a logical procedure called
            dialectics to seek answers to seemingly mutual exclusive
            positions. Shortened it is "thesis, antithesis, synthesis".
            Thus 'no light' and 'no dark' can arrive at a middle ground
            through logical examination 'it's dark but it can be made
            light'.
        How many Platonists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            They don't change bulbs, they have nice fires in their caves
            and if they need light they go out and look at the sun.
        How many New Historicists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            None-historical forces will do it. The bulb-screwer is a
            relatively modern invention.
        How many folklorists does it take to change a light bulb?
            Ten. One to change it and nine to document it.
        How many deconstructionists does it take to screw in a light
            bulb?
              1. It doesn't matter. Even if the bulb is screwed in, it
                 will always be flickering, however faintly, so it really
                 hasn't worked. It is incapable of delivering
                 uninterrupted light.
              2. You have to examine the nature of the question.
        How many chickens does it take to screw in a light bulb?
              1. Two-one to do it and one to cross the road.
              2. Just one, and she'll screw it in as soon as she decides
                 it isn't going to hatch.
              3. None. They're all far too busy crossing the road.
        How many kindergarden kids does it take to change a light bulb?
            One, two, three... Mummy! can I use my toes?
        How many Pizza Hut employees does it take to screw in a light
            bulb?
            Three-one to do it, one to hold the ladder, and one to tell
            the story about "last night."
            Note: This is guaranteed true by someone who used to work
            there. The stories refer to wild copious drinking and also a
            few bedroom exploits.
        How many undertakers does it take to change a light bulb?
            None. They just paint them black and go on using them.
        How many talk show hosts does it take to change a light bulb?
            Three, one to screw in the new bulb, one to ask the old one
            how it feels to be replaced, and one to take questions from
            the audience.
        How many gun control advocates does it take to screw in a light
            bulb?
              1. Let the police do it - private citizens can't be trusted
                 with light bulbs !
              2. They don't do that; they pass laws against burned-out
                 bulbs, and then they wonder why it's still so dark.
                 Meanwhile, a lot of people get hurt because they can't
                 see.
        How many NRA members does it take to screw in a light bulb?
              1. 3-One to give up the old bulb when they pry it from his
                 cold dead fingers, one to screw it in and pose for an
                 "I'm the NRA" ad while doing so, and one to complain
                 about the waiting period.
              2. Two, one to do it and the other one to get his dick out
                 of the gun.
        How many Newfies does it take to change a light bulb?
            Two. One to bite the bulb out of the socket and one to hammer
            the new one in. (A stereotype of Newfoundlanders as stupid -
            usually told by Canadians.)
        How many baby boomers does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            Ten-four to talk about how great it is that they've all come
            together to do this, one to screw it in, one to film it for
            the news, one to plan a marketing strategy based on it, one
            to reminisce about mass naked bulb screwings in the '60s, one
            to watch reruns of '50s TV shows, and one to play classic
            rock.
        How many (generation) Xers does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            
            Two, one to go and shoplift the bulb so the boomers have
            something to screw in and the other to screw it in for
            minimum wage.
        How many vampires does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            None, they like it in the dark.

            Two, but they have to be really tiny.
        How many CND supporters does it take to change a light bulb?
            None. They won't, because:
               o "I'm not about to touch anything that has WATT written
                 on it!"
               o "If we change our bulb, they will just change theirs to
                 a brighter one, so where will it all end?"
               o "We already have enough bulbs to illuminate the entire
                 world three times over."
               o "We shouldn't spend money for light bulbs as long as
                 anyone is hungry anywhere."
               o "We don't know what effect all this artificial light
                 will have on the future of mankind."
               o "Nature provides us with all the light we need; we just
                 haven't learned to husband it yet."
               o "Artificial light isn't aesthetically correct."
               o "The candle is more traditional, and it uses no
                 electricity."
               o "It is the responsibility of the Federal Government to
                 provide light to all Americans, without regard to race,
                 age, creed, color sex (anatomic), sex (persuasion),
                 religion, socio-economic status, national origin, or
                 need."
        How many furries does it take to change a light bulb?
            Four. One to climb up the ladder and change the light bulb.
            Three to protect the first with overkill-type weaponry, wear
            clothing which emphasizes curves and musculature, and look
            cute and dangerous at the same time.
            Note: furries = characters in what's called "furry" science
            fiction. Best depicted on cover art; the men look like
            bodybuilders, the women are indescribably buxom, and both
            wear some version of Tarzan/Jane-style costumes to show as
            much skin and musculature as possible.
        How many furfen does it take to change a light bulb?
            Three. One to climb up the ladder and change the light bulb.
            One to complain that there was too much erotica in the
            previous answer and this one, and that people should come up
            with more non-erotic answers because of the impact on public
            negativity towards furriness. And the third to explain about
            their erotic dreams involving furry light bulb jokes.
            Note: furfen = fans of furries. "fen" is a long-used plural
            for "fan".
        How many editors of Poor Richard's Almanac does it take to
            replace a light bulb?
            Many hands make light work.
            Note: "Poor Richard's Almanac" is a classic of colonial
            Americana, written (pseudonymously) by Ben Franklin in the
            1740s. It advocates a simple, thrifty lifestyle in the form
            of aphorisms, including that one, so it makes a nice play on
            words.
        How many big black monoliths does it take to change a light bulb?
            
            Sorry, light bulbs are an evolutionary dead end.
            Note: It might be something to do with the film - 2001 Space
            Odyssey. It's more the book, actually. That and "The Lost
            Worlds of 2001" should help illuminate this one. The big
            black monoliths, according to the books, are meant to help
            man evolve, something sort of hinted at in the film but more
            explicitly stated in the books.
        How many light bulbs does it take to change a light bulb?
            One, if it knows its own Goedel number.
            (Could somebody please explain this one to me ! I think it's
            something to do with the maths/logic theories of Kurt Goedel,
            about it being impossible to prove things.)
        How many Bayesians/subjectivists does it take to screw in a light
            bulb?
            As many as you think it takes.
            P.S. Fortunately, the author has learned much about Bayesian
            inference (and about the subjectivity inherent in "classical"
            inference) since then -- so spare us the flames about the
            misperceptions on which the above joke is based.
        How many dadaists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            To get to the other side.
            Note: The "dadaist" answer, like dadaism itself, goes further
            than the surrealist one. Whereas the surrealist one at least
            bears the semblance of a relationship to the question, the
            dadaist one is the punchline to another joke entirely.
        How many spies does it take to change a light bulb?
            Why bother?
            (I guess the point is that spies like to do everything in the
            dark anyway?)
        How many EST followers does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            A roomful. They take turns as the leader tells them what
            rotten and worthless bulb screwers they are. No one is
            allowed to leave the room to go to the bathroom while the
            bulb screwing is in progress.
            Note: EST (Erhard Seminars Training) was some sort of
            self-esteem-building programme that was popular in the late
            1970s. The sessions were as described in the punchline.
        How many Amish does it take to screw in a light bulb?
              1. Two, one to hold the bulb and the other to tell him it's
                 against the will of God.
              2. Amish don't have light bulbs. They bake pies.
        Note: The Amish are a people, also known as the "Pennsylvania
            Dutch", who mostly (though not exclusively) live in
            southeastern Pennsylvania and are noted for their religion.
            They adhere to a strict code of living that forbids using
            such modern conveniences as electricity and automobiles, and
            indeed often look and act as if they were time travelers from
            the early nineteenth century (they drive around in horse and
            buggy carts). They are descended from German Protestant
            immigrants of that time (hence the "Dutch" as the immigration
            people misunderstood "Deutsch", the answer they gave for
            nationality). Their quaint lifestyle draws many people to SE
            PA every year, where they often have a chance to sample their
            sweet pies and cakes. Hence the joke.
        How many NSC members does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. We can't say.
              2. Three, in fourteen countries.
        Note: The NSC is the US National Security Council, whose rubric
            Oliver North was acting under, and which is often accused by
            people such as Gore Vidal of secretly governing the country.
        How many Dune Coons does it take to replace a light bulb?
            Three - one to hold the bulb and two to turn the stool, but
            they need a foreign adviser to tell them it was burned out.
            Note: I presume a "Dune Coon" means a 3rd world peasant.
        How many supply-siders does it take to change a light bulb?
            None. The darkness will cause the light bulb to change by
            itself.
            Note: "Supply-siders" were the force behind Reagan's early
            reforms, and their economic theories were just like those of
            Thatcher (only the Thatcherites were more extreme). They
            believed that if they shifted the focus of government
            economic policy to stimulating supply rather than demand, the
            business cycle would be stopped at an agreeable point and
            inflation would be permanently whipped. Obviously, it didn't
            quite work out that way.
        How many Ann Arborites does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            None, they just start a "Coping With Darkness" support group.
            Note: Ann Arbor is a where, not a who. It's the home of the
            University of Michigan, which has a fairly liberal
            reputation.
        How many Lacanians does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            Three-one to do it, one to desire it, and the ignorant Other.
            Note: Jacques Lacan (1901-82) was a prominent French
            psychoanalyst and theorist who is very influential with
            literary critics at the moment. This relates to his theories.
        How many gypsies does it take to change a light bulb?
            None, but you lose a lot of light bulbs.
            Note: None because gypsies don't have mains electricity, and
            the losing is a play on the larcenous reputation of Gypsies.
            You give a Gypsy a light bulb and ask him to change the
            hallway lamp, pretty soon you have one less light bulb and
            the hallway lamp is still out.
        How many Helmsley employees does it take to change a light bulb?
            100: 99 to try, and one to fire them all.
            Note: Leona Helmsley is the owner of a (New York?) hotel who
            was a real bitch to work for. She fired employees at little
            or no provocation.
        How many marginals does it take to change a light bulb?
            Two: One to screw it in real good, and one to call the
            proctologist.
            Note: Anyone know what a marginal is or does? It sounds like
            a rude reference to a supposed homosexual practice of putting
            foreign objects in each others' rectums. Perhaps "marginal"
            is some regional insulting term for some kind of male
            homosexual?
        How many Martians does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            One and a half. (Is this a science-fiction in-joke?)
        Why did the light bulb fall out of the tree?
              1. Cos it was doing an impersonation of the sun, setting.
              2. Cos Christmas tree decorations are always cheap and
                 nasty.
              3. Cos it was autumn. (eh?)
        (Thus combining the twin themes of light bulb jokes and jokes
            about things falling out of trees...)
        How many Tauruses does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. None: Tauruses don't like to change anything.
              2. One. But only if they can celebrate afterwards with a
                 ten course meal and some great sex.
              3. One, but just try to convince them that the burnt out
                 bulb is useless and should be thrown away.
        How many Geminis does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Two (of course) but it will take all week, and when
                 they're done the light bulb will do your homework, speak
                 French, and shine any color you want it to.
              2. Two. Plus a portable phone, an Internet link and a copy
                 of the 'Bluffer's Guide to Changing Light Bulbs.'
              3. Two, but they never change it - they just keep arguing
                 about who is supposed to do it and how it's supposed to
                 be done.
        How many Cancerians does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Just one. But it takes a therapist three years to help
                 them through the grief process.
              2. Just one, and they'll use a non-disposable diaper too!
              3. None: Cancerians would worry themselves to death with
                 the problem.
        How many Leos does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Leos don't change light bulbs, although sometimes their
                 agents get a Virgo in to do it for them while they're
                 out.
              2. None: Leos are so enthusiastic they carry their own
                 light.
        How many Virgos does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Virgos don't have time to change their own light bulbs.
                 They're too busy changing them for everyone else.
              2. Approximately 1.000000 with an error of +/- 1 millionth.
              3. Let's see: One to spot the bulb, one to record the time
                 the bulb burned out and the date it was bought, one to
                 decide who's fault it is the bulb burned out and ask why
                 that brand was chosen in the first place, ten to decide
                 to remodel the house as long as they're changing the
                 bulb...
        How many Libras does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Er, two. Or maybe one. No - on second thoughts, make
                 that two. Is that okay with you?
              2. Why change the bulb? Isn't it more romantic in the dark?
              3. Well gee, I don't know really. I guess it depends on the
                 bulb and where it burned out. It might perhaps take just
                 one if it's just an ordinary bulb, but maybe two if the
                 person doesn't know where to find a new light bulb,
                 or...
        How many Scorpios does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Why do you want to know? Are you a cop?
              2. None - they'd rather sit in the dark.
              3. That information is strictly secret and only shared with
                 the inner members of the heirarchical Order.
        How many Sagittarians does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Look, ask me when I get back from India, okay?
              2. The sun is shining, the day is young, we've got our
                 whole lives ahead of us, and you're inside worrying
                 about a stupid burned out light bulb?
              3. A whole bunch: I can only keep them in the room long
                 enough for them to give the bulb a quarter turn a piece.
        How many Capricorns does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. None. Capricorns can't afford new light bulbs - unless
                 they're a legitimate business expense.
              2. I don't waste my time with these childish jokes.
              3. None: Why should I bother? It's probably just going to
                 burn out again tomorrow anyway.
        How many Aquarians does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Well, you have to remember that everything is energy
                 so...
              2. A hundred, but they'll all be competing to be the one to
                 change the bulb and bring light to the world.
              3. Like, why don't you just get out of my face and stop
                 asking me to do all your work for you? I'm, like, really
                 totally sick and tired of you asking me questions.
        How many Pisceans does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Huh? The light's out?
              2. What light bulb?
              3. None: They concern themselves with inner light.
        How many Arians does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. None: Arians aren't afraid of the dark.
              2. Just the one. You want to make something of it, eh?
              3. Only one, but it takes a lot of light bulbs. (smash)

OperHmmmmm. You put in a fresh bulb?

Blonde: Yes.

Blonde: Yes, yes.

 There were three people stranded on an island, a 
brunette, a redhead, and a blonde. The brunette 
looked over the water to the mainland and estimated 
about 20 miles to shore. So she announced, "I'm 
going to try to swim to shore." So she swam out five 
miles, and got really tired. She swam out ten miles 
from the island, and she was too tired to go on, so 
she drowned.

 The second one, the redhead, said to herself, "I 
wonder if she made it. I guess it's better to try to get 
to the mainland than stay here and starve." So she 
attempts to swim out. The redhead had a lot more 
endurance than the brunette, as she swam out 10 
miles before she even got tired. After 15 miles, she 
was too tired to go on, so she drowned. 

 So the blonde thought to herself, "I wonder if they 
made it! I think I'd better try to make it, too." So she 
swam out 5 miles, ten miles, 15 miles, NINETEEN 
miles from the island. The shore was just in sight, but 
she said, "I'm too tired to go on!" So she swam back.

when one looked down and said "Oh, look at the 
deer tracks." The other blonde looks and says "Those 
arn't deer tracks, those are wolf tracks." "No. Those 
are deer tracks." They keep arguing, and arguing, 
and one half hour later they were both killed by a 
train.

42.

The blonde came running downstairs, crying. Her 
mother asked what was wrong and the blonde said 
her boyfriend had just dropped her. Her mother (a 
blonde) nodded wisely and proceeded to tell her 
about the birds and the bees and the blonde s"No 
ma. I can fuck and suck with the best of them. But he 
says I can't cook"

43.

A blonde was telling a priest a Pollock joke, when 
halfway through the priest interrupts her, "Don't 
you know I'm Polish?"

 "Oh, I'm sorry," the blonde apologizes, "do you 
want me to start over and talk slower?"

44.

Three blondes were walking through the desert 
when found a magic genie's lamp t he said, "I will 
grant three wishes, one for each of you." The first 
said, "I wish I were smarter". So she became a

smarter than her." She became a brunette. The third 
blond said "I wish I were smarter than both of 
them." So she became a man.

At a carwash in Burbank, there were two identical

49.

A blonde friend of mine was looking for some 
transportation, so I bought her a Woody. I called her 
up later and asked how she like it. She told me it was 
OK, but that it didn't look so good once she had 
taken it out of the crate.

50.

A blonde goes into the drug store to buy some 
rubbers (so she can practice safe sex). She walks up 
to the pharmicist and asks "How much for a box of 
rubbers?" 

"They're $1 for a box of 3," he replied, "Plus 6 cents 
for the tax."

them on."

This guy just started at his new job, working at a 
porno shop. His boss comes out and tells him that he 
has to leave for a while, and "can you handle it? "The 
new employee is somewhat reluctant, but with the 
boss's positive comments he finally agrees. 

So, the guy is there by himself for a little while and 
a white woman comes in. 

She asks, "How much for the white dildo?"

He answers, "$35."

She: "How much for the black one?"

He: "$35 for the black one, $35 for the white one."

She: "I think I'll take the black one. I've never had a 
black one before." She pays him, and off she goes.

 A little bit later a black woman comes in and asks 
"How much for the black dildo?"

He: "$35."

She: "How much for the white one?"

He: "$35 for the white one, $35 for the black one."

She: "Hmmm...I think I'll take the white one. I've 
never had a white one before..."

She pays him, and off she goes. About an hour later 
a young blonde woman comes in and asks, "How 
much are your dildos?"

He: "$35 for the white, $35 for the black."

She: "Hmmmmm....how much is that plaid one on 
the shelf?"

He: "Well, that's a very special dildo...it'll cost you 
$165."

She thinks for a moment and answers, "I'll take the 
plaid one, I've never had a plaid one before...."

She pays him, and off she goes. 

 Finally, the guy's boss returns and asks, "How did 
you do while I was gone?"

To which the saleman responded, "I did really 
good, I sold one white dildo, one black dildo, and I 
sold your thermos for $165!"

53.

 A young blonde woman is asked out on a date and 
accepts. The boy picks her up and they go to a 
nearby carnival in town. They ride a few rides, play a 
few games, and seem to be generally hitting it off 
well. During a sort of romantic lull, however, the boy 
says, "What do you want to do now?"

"I want a weigh," she says.

Well, OK, thinks the boy. They walk over to the 
fortune scales, and weigh her. They play a few more 
games and stop for foods.

"What do you want to do now?" asks the boy 
again.

"I want a weigh," she says.

Hmmm, a little odd but I'll put up with it, thinks 
the boy. Again they get her weight and fortune.

After yet another few games and an exquisite 
fireworks show, the boy repeats, "What do you want 
to do now?"

"I want a weigh," she says.

Damn, thinks the boy, she's just too weird for me. 
They get her weight and fortune, and the boy drives 
her home.

As she walks into the house, her sister asks, 
"How'd your date go?"

"Wousy," says the girl.

"Having a wonderful time....Where am I?"

that she played third string at a car wash?

After many hours of extremely acrobatic and 
exhausting sex with a blonde he had just picked up, 
a man goes into the kitchen for some food to 
replenish his just-spent energy. He pours himself a 
glass of milk and right before drinking it, he realizes 
his manhood is still pretty hot, so he sticks it in the 
glass to cool it off. Just then the blonde walks in and 
says, "Oh, I always wondered how you refilled 
those."

58.

A blonde and a brunette were talking one day. The 
brunette said that her boyfriend had a slight

Did you hear what the blonde who was opening a 
new bar said when her lawyer explained to her that 
she needed a liquor license?

There was a blonde driving down the road 
listening to the radio. The announcer was telling 
blonde joke after blonde joke until the blonde was 
mad enough she turned her radio off. A mile down 
the road, she saw another blonde out in a corn field 
in a boat rowing. The blonde stopped her car jumped 
out and yelled, "You bimbo, it's blondes like you that 
give us all a bad name. If I could swim I'd come out 
there and give you what's coming to you!"

63. 

A dumb blonde was bragging about her 
knowledge of the state capitals (or for Bill Clinton 
capitols). She proudly said," go ahead, ask me, I 
know all of them."

A red head said, "O.K., what's the capital of 
Wisconsin?"

The blonde replied, "Oh, that's easy, 'W'."

64.

 A blonde was walking along, when she looked up 
to observe a bird flying overhead. Suddenly, the bird 
drops a load when it was directly over her. The 
blonde says, "Good thing I had my mouth open, or 
that would've hit me right in the face!!!" 

 Or: "Good thing that cows don't fly.

A man walks into a bar, with a huge alligator on a 
leash. He walks over to the bar, and orders a beer. 
The bartender says "Sorry sir. You can't bring that 
alligator in here! It's a dangerous animal, and you're 
scaring all of the patrons! 

True enough, the man looked around, and noticed 
that everyone was standing on the tables, looking 
very nervous. "But wait!" he cried, "this alligator is 
tame! It wouldn't hurt anyone!". However, the 
bartender is adamant. "If", the man continues, "I can 
prove that this alligator is not vicious, can he stay?". 
"Well, I guess so", says the bartender, "however, 
you're going to have a devil of a time proving to 
everyone in here that that alligator is tame!" The man 
smiles, and leans over the alligator. 

"Ralph!", he shouts, "Sit up!" With that, he beats 
the alligator on the head with his fist "BANG BANG 
BANG". And the alligator rears up on its tail. 
"Ralph, open your mouth! BANG BANG BANG". 
And the alligator opened it's huge mouth wide, 
revealing row upon row of gleaming white teeth. 
The man pulls out his wang, and lays it in the 
alligators mouth, as the entire bar crowd gasps. 
"Ralph! Close your mouth, but DON'T BITE! BANG 
BANG BANG". As the man pummels the alligator 
on the head, the giant mouth slowley closes, and 
stops juuuussttt short of biting the guys dick off. 

The crowd sighs, and the man says "Ralph, open 
your mouth! BANG BANG BANG!" and the 
alligators mouth opens wide again. "There,"says the 
man to the crowd, " now would anyone else like to 
try this?" 

A blonde in the back says "Yeah, I'll try, but only if 
your promise not to hit me on the head so hard".

            world-class bulb screwing.
         2. One, but he leaves the old bulb in the parking lot of the
            Walden Galleria.
            Note: The Walden Galleria Mall, only an hour and a half away
            from the Centre of the Universe and just off the Interstate
            in Buffalo, New York, was the Mecca of Torontonians engaging
            in the old Canadian tradition of cross border shopping. On a
            weekend the parking lot would be so full of Ontario plates
            you would think that you were in Canada. Of course you could
            not legally return to Canada with more than $25 worth of
            goods for an afternoon visit and so thousands of honest,
            polite and industrious Canadians were turned into lowlife
            smugglers. The classic method for smuggling clothing was
            "wearing it back" and so long lines of cars containing
            scantily and poorly dressed Canadians would patiently queue
            up Sunday morning to cross into New York State and a few
            hours later, miraculously, in the true American tradition of
            rags to riches, be transformed into trendy and well attired
            Torontonians as they returned home satiated by an intensive
            afternoon of power shopping with nothing to declare to Canada
            Customs, leaving their rags behind to grace the dumpsters of
            the exotic malls of Williamsburg and Cheektawoga. This all
            ended with the introduction of Sunday shopping in Ontario in
            1992 and the steadily declining value of the Canadian dollar.
            Sorry I got so long winded, but Sunday in Buffalo was fun
            while it lasted, even if you got caught and this joke, lame
            as it is, brought back a lot of memories.
            
   How many Filipinoes does it take to screw in a light bulb?

          checkers at the Lowenbrau brewery here in the beautiful city of
          Munich where they have to carefully check that each and every
          stage of the bier brewing process adheres to the Reinheitsgebot
          ancient brewing laws laid down in 1516 which set minimum
          standards for the purity of the ingredients otherwise they'd be
          subject to extremely enormous fines so quality control is a
          very important job both in terms of the quality of all the

          As long as lighting levels are within operational parameters,
          he doesn't !

   How many software engineers does it take to change a light bulb?
          
         1. None. "We'll document it in the manual."
         2. None. It's a hardware problem.
         3. One, but if he changes it, the whole building will probably
            fall down.
         4. Two. One always leaves in the middle of the project.
         5. Four. One to design the change, one to implement it, one to
            document it, and one to maintain it afterwards.
         6. Four, plus one senior analyst to manage the project, one
            technical writer to correct the spelling and grammar of the
            one who documented it, one light bulb librarian, a
            sales-force of at least five to drum up enough users who want
            to turn the light on, 274 users to burn out the new bulb, at
            which point we go to tender for another light bulb change,...
         7. Five. Two to write the specification program, one to screw it
            in, and two to explain why the project was late.
         8. Wait! Maybe the bulb isn't broken. Let's try it again.
         9. It's hard to say. Each time we separate the bulb into its
            modules to do unit testing, it stops working.
        10. The change is 90 percent complete.
        11. We looked at the light fixture and decided there's no point
            trying to maintain it. We're going to rewrite it from
            scratch. Could you wait two months?
        12. Only one, but she's not available. She's the only programmer
            we have who can get the <insert name here> software ready to
            ship to customers, and that's higher priority, you know.
        13. Of course, as everyone knows, just five years ago all it took
            was a bunch of kids in a garage in Palo Alto to change a
            light bulb.

   How many C++ programmers does it take to change a light bulb?
          
         1. You're still thinking procedurally. A properly designed light
            bulb object would inherit a change method from a generic
            light bulb class, so all you'd have to do is send a light
            bulb change message.
         2. Only one, but it takes him all night, and when he's done, the
            refrigerator and toilet don't work.
         3. At least a dozen, but it's impossible to tell which one it
            is, because they're all pointing at each other going "That's
            me, over there !"
            
   How many Object Oriented programmers does it take to change a light
          bulb?
          None, they send it a message, and it changes itself.
          
   How many Microsoft Visual C++ programmers does it take ....
          400. 1 to change the bulb, 50 to write a magazine about it, 50
          to write a help file about it, 50 to code a little gadget so
          when you hit the bulb it will announce all the names of the
          team involved, 50 to go down to the drinks machine and get
          everyone their can of coke, 50 to show off about how installing
          a light bulb for Bill has made them paper millionaires, 1 to
          answer the phone at the help desk ("Putting you through to our
          light bulb expert sir... click"), 148 to pad out the pictures
          in the "Light Bulb - how we did it" magazine.

         1. Hmmm, I'm not sure, better find out....
            Hmmm, I'm not sure, better find out....
            Note: LISP is a recursive programming language. One problem
            LISP programmers have to contend with is infinite recursion.
            (cf computer dictionary entry: recursion - see recursion)
            These lisp heads are usually research AI types and their
            standard answer is as in the punchline. It could be improved:
         2. (((H)mmm,) (I'm ((not) sure, better))) (find (out))...
            
   How many data base people does it take to change a light bulb?
          Three: One to write the light bulb removal program, one to

          None. You don't need a new lightbulb - you need to upgrade your
          socket to the '486 version.
          
   How many software vendors does it take to change a light bulb?
          None: You have to do it yourself, pay them $99 for the
          privilege, and re-wire your sockets to suit the new bulb.
          
   How many field service engineers does it take to replace a dead light
          bulb?
          
         1. Who can tell. FSE's are always in the dark.
         2. Two. One to hold the bulb and one to pound it in (etc)
         3. Well, the diagnostics all check out fine, so it's a software
            problem.
            
   How long will it take?
          That's indeterminate. It depends on how many dead bulbs they've
          brought with them.
          
   What if you have two dead bulbs?
          They replace your fuse box.

          IBM staff don't change light bulbs - they add value to photon
          emitter units.
          
   How many IBM engineers does it take to screw in a light bulb?
          None. They just let Marketing explain that "Dead Bulb" is a
          feature.

          33. One to change the lightbulb and the other 32 to write 14
          volumes of documentation of which half consists of pages
          containing only "This page left intentionally blank" and the
          other half definitions such as " 'bulb' can be defined as a
          glass and metal object with certain electrical properties (see
          volume IX, "The Electrical Properties Of A Bulb Used For
          Illumination") designed to mate with a housing integral to the
          ceiling referred to as a "socket" (see volume VII, "Bayonet Cap
          Sockets" and volume VIII, "Edison Screw Sockets"; if uncertain
          of the socket type please see volume II, "Lighting Sockets - A

            first.
            
   How many IBM tech writers does it take to screw in a light bulb?

            to do it.
         2. 100. Ten to do it, and 90 to write document number
            GC7500439-0001, Multitasking Incandescent Source System
            Facility, of which 10 percent of the pages state only "This page
            intentionally left blank", and 20 percent of the definitions are of
            the form "A ...... consists of sequences of non-blank
            characters separated by blanks".

         1. None - it will be fined (fixed ?) in the next version.
         2. They aren't certain, everytime they do the math, they get a
            different number.
         3. 1.99904274017, but that's close enough for non-technical
            people.
         4. Three. One to screw in the bulb and the other to hold the
            ladder....
         5. 586 of them, and it will take them a year from the moment you
            convince them that the light bulb is not functioning per the
            spec.

   How many Microsoft employees does it take to change a light bulb?
          
         1. One - but Bill Gates must inspect every single bulb and
            socket before the operation is started.
         2. Eight: one to work the bulb and seven to make sure Microsoft
            gets $2 for every light bulb ever changed anywhere in the
            world.

   How many Windows users does it take to change a light bulb?
          One, but she/he'll swear up and down that it was JUST as easy
          for him as it would be for a Macintosh user.

          Only one, but why bother? Your light socket will just be
          obsolete in six months anyway.
          
   How many Mac owners does it take to screw in a light bulb?
          
         1. None - there's no documentation available, so you have to
            wait until a third-party supplier comes out with a solution.
         2. Did you try rebooting with extensions off?
         3. Just one, but the new light bulbs aren't compatible with the
            old sockets, so he has to buy a complete upgrade or a new
            light.
         4. Two: One to ask the socket to eject the old bulb, and one to
            insert the new one.
         5. Three: One to change the bulb, one to copyright the method
            for changing the bulb, and one to call in the lawyers on
            anyone who infringes on the "look and feel" of the bulb
            changing method.
         6. Mac users don't screw, they just click the genital icon.
            
   How many Apple and IBM nuts does it take to change a light bulb?
          An infinite number: nothing useful gets done while they're
          arguing. Finally a disgusted generic computer user (who will
          use any type that is in front of him) gets up and changes the
          bulb, elbowing the participants aside. The size of the crowd
          arguing seems to be a function of time, although whether or not
          the function is exponential is not known.
          
   How many light bulbs does it take to screw Netscape?
          Four. One for employees of non-profit organisations, one for
          students and educators, one for people who can read a license
          agreement, one for people who expect a company to keep its
          word.
          Note: Refers to Netscape Corp., which distributed betas of
          their Web browser for free, announcing that the final version
          will be free also. Once the final version was out, they changed
          their mind. Only for students, educators and employees of
          non-profit organisations does it remain free.
          
   How many Unix hacks does it take to change a light bulb?
          
         1. As many as you want; they're all virtual, anyway.

          and as such won't fit your particular implementation of the
          socket. (However you do have the source code for your socket,
          so .....)
          
   How many VMS heads does it take to change a light bulb?
          
         1. All of them, and they will all scream at you in unison and
            tell you that the only light bulb you can use is a 100-watt
            soft white but you can use any 100-watt soft white as long as
            it's manufactured by DEC.
         2. "Errr... Well, I've got a patch that I could apply to it, but
            if you can just wait till next year, it'll all be fixed when
            we upgrade to light bulb version 6.1..."

          directors. Is the difference intentional? Should one or the
          other instance be changed? It seems inconsistent.

        In earlier work, Wiener [1] has shown that one mathematician can
            change a light bulb.
            If k mathematicians can change a light bulb, and if one more
            simply watches them do it, then k+1 mathematicians will have
            changed the light bulb.
            Therefore, by induction, for all n in the positive integers,
            n mathematicians can change a light bulb.

            Note: Someone has been asking this as a bonus question on
            statistics exam papers for quite a while. Judging from some
            of his own students' exam answers, it depends on whether the
            light bulb is negatively or positively screwed.

         3. The probability that the light bulb will actually be changed
            in any time interval is independent of how long you've been
            waiting.

   How many quantum physicists does it take to change a light bulb?
          One. Two to do it, and one to renormalise the wave function.
          (Explanation - Renormalising the wave function is something
          that has to be done to a lot of quantum physics calculations to

   How many surgeons does it take to change a light bulb?
          
         1. None. They would wait for a suitable donor and do a filament
            transplant.
         2. Three. They'd also like to remove the socket as you aren't
            using it now.
            
   How many orthopedic surgeons does it take to change a light bulb?
          Why don't you just let us take out the socket? You aren't using
          it anyway, and it will only cause you trouble later.

          glass into the bulb shape, one to coil the tungsten wire
          filament, one to clean up the metal base of the old bulb, one
          to operate the vacuum pump to get rid of the air in the bulb
          and one to apply the glue to seal the new bulb into the old
          base. The new bulb won't work, of course, but the whole process
          uses up a lot of expensive equipment and keeps several
          intelligent people happily employed doing something totally
          useless.
          
   How many emergency room technicians does it take to change a light

            sat on the other one's shoulder so that they were able to

                 for it!
              2. Just one, but he gets 3 hours of credit for it. (or the
                 Heisman, if Barry Switzer can get enough Alumni support
                 for it) Note: The Heisman is a trophy awarded to the
                 supposed best overall college football player each
                 season by the NY Athletic Club. Barry Switzer was
                 formerly the University of Oklahoma football coach, one
                 of the winningest ever. The joke relates to the fact
                 that the school's publicity department has as much, if
                 not more, to do with getting the Heisman than the
                 player's actual ability.
                 (Commentary from another American! Not exactly... OU has
                 had a few Heisman trophy winners, but only one of them
                 when Switzer was head coach (thus the joke's really not
                 that funny). Now if you changed it to Woody Hayes,
                 former head coach at coach at Ohio State, or Bo
                 Schembechler, former Michigan head coach, it might be
                 more humorous.)

            (Commentary from an American: Oh, please <groan> :-). I live
            in Buffalo, so it's a slightly sore subject. This relates to
            recent Super Bowls. The Broncos have been to four Super
            Bowls, and lost three by huge margins-"blowouts". Likewise
            the Bills, the pride and joy of our city, have lost the last
            three straight, the last two by overwhelming margins.)

                 minute, one to pretend to twist the new one in round and
                 round so far it almost breaks, and some guy in a black
                 and white stripey uniform whose function is never made

            pawns while all this action takes place on the other side of
            the board, and one to flash its lights, make lots of noise,

               o There must be no discrimination against dark bulbs in

                 take their place alongside light bulbs on a basis of

               o We affirm the right of all bulbs to screw into the

            bulb?
            None. They will never find one that burned as brightly as the
            first one.
            Notes on the previous 3: Chassidim (pronounced
            "hass-ee-deem"-it's Hebrew) are an orthodox Jewish sect. The
            jokes above refer to various further subsects and their
            peculiarities. The Lubavitchers, the most prevalent, are
            known for their belief that the Mossiach (Messiah) will be
            coming along soon. The Bratzlaver joke refers to the fact
            that they all revered their founder, the Rabbi Nachman, and
            since he died they haven't really replaced him, as nobody in
            the group feels capable of filling his shoes. The Satmar are
            very strict in their adherence to the sex-role distinctions
            prescribed by the Bible-in one area, they've been fighting
            with local authorities about school busing, because they
            believe that women should not be allowed to drive, and the
            school system employs a lot of women as bus drivers.

              1. That's not funny, abusive white male aggressor!!
              2. None. It's not the light bulb that needs changing.
              3. Who cares as long as one of 'em sucks my cock.
              4. "Hey man, screwing objectifies the LB"
              5. Two..............IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH
                 THAT?????!!!!???
              6. Two - one to change the bulb and one to write about how
                 it feels.
              7. Two - one to change it and one to threaten to do a
                 Lorena Bobbitt on any man who tries to interfere.
              8. Three - one to do it, the others to consider unscrewing
                 it before it's a third of the way in.
              9. Three - one to screw it in and two to talk about the
                 sexual implications.
             10. Five, four to try like men and fail miserably, one to
                 find a female electrician, settle for a man and picket
                 as he works.
             11. Seven. One to change the light bulb, three to protest
                 the offense committed by the light bulb in regards to
                 the socket, two to secretly wish they were the socket,
                 and one to secretly wish she was the light bulb.
             12. 11. 1 to change the light bulb and 10 to form a
                 survivors of darkness support group!
             13. Seventy. One to change it while the others make a 69.
             14. 100. One to change it, and 99 to wring their hands and
                 agonize about how oppressed the socket is.
             15. How old-fashioned. The other 99 are there to lobby
                 Congress to outlaw crimes against sockets -- and to say
                 the bulb-changer is not a representative of mainstream
                 feminism.
             16. 50,000 marching on Ottawa (or Washington) demanding the
                 LB be changed!
             17. That depends. If there is money in it, it takes 10
                 women-only-government- contractors working 2 years at a
                 salary of $50,000 per year. Otherwise, it's
                 traditionally expected for the man to do it.
             18. Ten: To form a university funded protest committee to
                 research how the white male patriarchy conspires to keep
                 women and minorities in the dark.
             19. Two. One to threaten that as a mother, she will be
                 unable to provide her children light without federal
                 assistance; and a N.O.W. attorney to ask the Justice
                 Department to sue GE for allowing the bulb to go out in
                 the first place.
             20. Nobody knows. But everyone knows that women and
                 minorities will suffer more than anyone else because
                 it's dark.
             21. None. Women have a supreme court, constitionally
                 protected right to work in the dark if they choose to.
             22. It's sexual harassment to even SUGGEST jokingly on the
                 net that a woman SCREW in anything. This posting will be
                 banned by the FCC.
             23. One. But if the bulb IS replaced, the job will go to a
                 minority or woman contractor.
             24. 30,000 to start a letter writing campaign protesting
                 Newt Gingrich cutting off funds for the Federal Light
                 Bulb Changing Agency...
             25. Three. One to screw it in, and two to file a sexual
                 harassment lawsuit on behalf of the bulb.
             26. Two. One to wait for a federal agency to send someone to
                 screw it in. Another to file harassment charges against
                 the men possibly looking at her in the dark.
             27. Feminists don't screw at all. That's what sperm banks
                 are for!
             28. If a feminist does screw in a light bulb, it will be up
                 to the government or the father to support any children
                 resulting from such a sexual act. She will also require
                 free day care for the light bulb children and federal
                 funding for studies of how light-bulb children should be
                 treated under affirmative action hiring quotas.
             29. Unknown. But the federal government's welfare reform
                 will limit the number of free light bulbs a woman can
                 receive to under 2 years supply.
             30. One. But if she was a WHITE MALE (like Donald Trump),
                 she would be able to replace the light bulb much easier.
             31. One. And when she replaces it, she will think of Mother
                 Earth and use a fluorescent lamp designed to last 3
                 times longer and protect the environment... But if a man
                 isn't paying for it, then she will use the cheapest one.
             32. Two, one to change it and one to tell her she did a
                 really good job.
        How many women does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. (It's a very simple task, so...) None. "It's a man's
                 job."
              2. None, they all get electrocuted trying to excite the
                 socket.
              3. Three: one to take out the old one, one to sweep up the

                 minds and provide wax jobs.
              3. None. Men don't screw-in light bulbs; they think they
                 can turn them on just by rubbing up against them.
              4. One -- men will screw anything.

                 about the screwing part.

                 for more bulbs.

              1. None. The consensus of opinion appears to be that there
                 is no such thing as a genuine new man, and in any event,
                 the media, who like telling us what we all like, have
                 declared that women don't really go for new men anyway,

            ask.
        How many real women does it take to change a light bulb?

                 prefer it with the lights off.

                 (as if that'll convince us all to change our beliefs),
                 74 to try and convince it to publicly "admit" its sins
                 so the lord can make it bright again, and 1 true idiot
                 telling the light bulb that if it really wants to be

                 pledge it 10 percent of its income and at least 1 day a week of

              2. 7. Scotty will report to Captain Kirk that the light
                 bulb in the Engineering Section is burnt out, to which
                 Kirk will send Bones to pronounce the bulb dead. Scotty,
                 after checking around, notices that they have no more
                 new light bulbs, and complains that he can't see in the
                 dark to tend to his engines. Kirk must make an emergency
                 stop at the next uncharted planet, Alpha Regula IV, to

                 Bones, Sulu, and 3 red shirt security officers beam
                 down. The 3 security officers are promptly killed by the
                 natives, and the rest of the landing party is captured.

                 approaching and must warp out of orbit to escape
                 detection. Bones cures the native king who is suffering
                 from the flu, and as a reward the landing party is set
                 free and given all of the light bulbs they can carry.
                 Scotty cripples the Klingon ship and warps back to the
                 planet just in time to beam up Kirk et. al. The new bulb
                 is inserted, and the Enterprise continues with its five
                 year mission.

            decides to call 911:
             Blonde:
                    We need help. We're three blondes changing a light
                    bulb.
             Operator:
                    Hmmmmm. You put in a fresh bulb?
             Blonde:
                    Yes.
             Operator:
                    The power in the house in on?
             Blonde:
                    Of course.
             Operator:
                    And the switch is on?
             Blonde:
                    Yes, yes.
             Operator:
                    And the bulb still won't light up?
             Blonde:
                    No, it's working fine.
             Operator:
                    Then what's the problem?
             Blonde:
                    We got dizzy spinning the ladder around and we all
                    fell and hurt ourselves.
        How many congressmen does it take to change a light bulb?
            Five hundred and thirty-five, but only if the following
            conditions are met: The light bulb will not be changed in an
            election year. A committee will study the light-bulb
            situation for at least a year. Taxes will have to be raised.
            A fair and proportionate number of the light-bulb changers
            will be from minority groups. No Social Security funds will
            be used to change the bulb. Each state and congressional
            district will share in the benefits of changing the light
            bulb. The blame for the failure of the present bulb will be
            assigned to the other party. The new bulb will be twice as
            bright as the old bulb. Because the new bulb is twice as
            bright as the old bulb, it will cost 130 times as much. A
            Blue Ribbon Panel will investigate the light-bulb failures
            and issue a mega-page report to the congress. A fact-finding
            trip to all countries known to produce light bulbs will be
            made by most congressmen and their wives. The CIA will
            investigate the Russian light-bulb-changing system. Details
            of the Russian light-bulb-changing system will be sold to the
            Chinese by an American naval officer. The surgeon general
            will issue a report about the perils of over-bright light
            bulbs. A program to supply light bulbs to those who cannot
            afford them will be introduced by Tip O'Neill. President
            Reagan will give a speech extolling the virtues of kerosene
            lanterns. Tip O'Neall will initiate a program of free
            kerosene for the needy. And finally, each and every
            congressman will send every one of his constituents a
            newsletter describing how he managed to get the light bulb
            changed almost single-handedly.

                 Now, if you're looking for a lawyer to screw a light
                 bulb...
              3. Whereas the party of the first part, also known as
                 "Lawyer", and the party of the second part, also known
                 as "Light Bulb", do hereby and forthwith agree to a
                 transaction wherein the party of the second part (Light
                 Bulb) shall be removed from the current position as a
                 result of failure to perform previously agreed upon
                 duties, i. E., the lighting, elucidation, and otherwise
                 illumination of the area ranging from the front (north)
                 door, through the entryway, terminating at an area just
                 inside the primary living area, demarcated by the
                 beginning of the carpet, any spillover illumination
                 being at the option of the party of the second part
                 (Light Bulb) and not required by the aforementioned
                 agreement between the parties. The aforementioned
                 removal transaction shall include, but not be limited
                 to, the following steps:
                   1. The party of the first part (Lawyer) shall, with or
                      without elevation at his option, by means of a
                      chair, stepstool, ladder or any other means of
                      elevation, grasp the party of the second part
                      (Light Bulb) and rotate the party of the second
                      part (Light Bulb) in a counter-clockwise direction,
                      this point being non-negotiable.
                   2. Upon reaching a point where the party of the second
                      part (Light Bulb) becomes separated from the party
                      of the third part ("Receptacle"), the party of the
                      first part (Lawyer) shall have the option of
                      disposing of the party of the second part (Light
                      Bulb) in a manner consistent with all applicable
                      state, local and federal statutes.
                   3. Once separation and disposal have been achieved,
                      the party of the first part (Lawyer) shall have the
                      option of beginning installation of the party of
                      the fourth part ("New Light Bulb"). This
                      installation shall occur in a manner consistent
                      with the reverse of the procedures described in
                      step one of this self-same document, being careful
                      to note that the rotation should occur in a
                      clockwise direction, this point also being
                      non-negotiable.
             NOTE: The above described steps may be performed, at the
                 option of the party of the first part (Lawyer), by any
                 or all persons authorized by him, the objective being to
                 produce the most possible revenue for the party of the
                 fifth part, also known as "Partnership."
        How many workers at Rocky Flats, the former nuclear weapon
            components plant in Golden, Colo., should it take to change a
            light bulb?
            Sixteen--and that's no joke:
            
            An internal memo written by a manager at the U.S. Department
            of Energy plant recommended a new safety procedure for "the
            replacement of a light bulb in a criticality beacon." The
            beacon, similar to the revolving red lamp atop a police car,
            warns workers of nuclear accidents. The memo said the job
            should take at least 16 people over 60 hours to replace the
            light. It added that the same job used to take 12 workers
            4.15 hours.
            
            The memo called for a planner to meet with six others at a
            work-control meeting; talk with other workers who have done
            the job before; meet again; get signatures from five people
            at that work-control meeting; get the project plans approved
            by separate officials overseeing safety, logistics, waste
            management and plant scheduling; wait for a monthly
            criticality-beacon test; direct electricians to replace the
            bulb; and then test and verify the repair. Mark Obmascik in
            Denver Post (reprinted in Reader's Digest)
        How many 'Cliffie girls does it take to change a light bulb?
            It's "Radcliffe Women" and it's not funny!
            Note: Radcliffe is the all-women's college near Harvard that
            used to be where women went before Harvard went co-ed. Since
            then it has earned a reputation for militant feminism as it
            has remained all-female. The joke is on feminists' supposed
            failure to laugh along at deprecatory remarks.
        How many Bratzlaver Chassidim does it take to change a light
            bulb?

            first one.
        How many <ethnics> does it take to screw in a light bulb?
              1. We don't know yet. No <ethnic> has ever tried to attempt
                 this complex (by <ethnic> standards) technical feat.
              2. 10. One to hold the bulb and nine to rotate the ladder.
        How many strong <ethnics> does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            115. One to hold the bulb and 114 to rotate the house.

            Two. One to hold the bulb and the other to rotate the planet.
        How many cabbage patch dolls does it take to change a light bulb?
            
            the question is irrelevant since you couldn't find the dolls
            even if you knew how many.
            Note: Topical to 1983 and the difficulty of obtaining cabbage
            patch dolls

            This topic was resumed from last week's discussion, but is
            incomplete pending resolution of some action items. It will
            be continued next week. Meanwhile...

        How many WASP Princesses does it take to screw in a light bulb?
              1. What?! And ruin my nails???
              2. Two. One to get a Tab and one to call Daddy.
              3. Two. One to call the electricion and one to fix the
                 Martinis.
              4. Three: Two to bitch about it, one to call the building
                 superintendant.
        Note: WASP Princess = spoilt rich girl, a Tab = a can of Tab the
            drink.
        How many junkies does it take to screw in a light bulb?
              1. Oh wow, is it like dark, man?

              1. One, but it takes twelve steps.
              2. One, as long as he admits he's powerless over light
                 bulbs.
              3. One to screw it in and one to sponsor him.

            Note: think height!
        How many existentialists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            Two: One to screw it in and one to observe how the light bulb
            itself symbolizes a single incandescent beacon of subjective
            reality in a netherworld of endless absurdity reaching out
            toward a maudlin cosmos of nothingness.
        How many dull people does it take to change a light bulb?
            one.
        How many big black monoliths does it take to change a light bulb?
            
            Sorry, light bulbs are an evolutionary dead end.
        How many philosophers does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Hmmm... well there's an interesting question isn't it?
              2. Three. One to change it and two to stand around arguing
                 over whether or not the light bulb exists.
              3. Define "light bulb".................
        How many Random Light Bulb Joke readers does it take to screw in
            a light bulb?
            None. They just wait for a new one to be loaded.
        How many Mensans does it take to screw in a litebulb?
            None. They know that litebulb is misspelled and therefore
            cannot exist to be screwed in. Now of course, if it were a
            Miller Lite bulb...
        How many Mensans does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. None. The bulb isn't bright enough.
              2. None. The dim bulbs aren't "changed," they are humanely
                 euthanized.
              3. 66. Eleven philosophers to ponder whether it is possible
                 to actually do anything; ten semanticists to debate the
                 various possible meanings of each phrase, word, and
                 syllable; nine columnists to write about it from
                 radically different viewpoints; eight letter writers to
                 respond vehemently with opposing points of view; seven
                 Quibblers who delight in pointing out others' mistakes
                 (what is said is not as important as saying it
                 correctly); six conservatives who believe things should
                 stay the way they are; five liberals who believe that
                 action should be taken immediately to form a committee
                 to study possible actions; four ornery SOBs who disagree
                 on principal with anything anyone else has suggested;
                 three peacemakers who believe it's more important to
                 work it out without showing any more emotions than
                 necessary to get it done; two statisticians who maintain
                 that numbers are more important than facts; and one
                 pragmatist to ignore the BS and replace the bad bulb
                 with a good one. Whilst all this is going on, all the
                 Mensans are keeping count in their heads just to make
                 absolutely sure that it really does add up to 66.
        How many light bulbs does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. One, if it knows its own Goedel number.
                 Note: A Goedel Number is one of several ways to encode a
                 Turing Machine, the classical abstraction of a computer,
                 or for that matter of any algorithm. The idea (as best I
                 see it) is that if the machine knows its own Goedel
                 Number it can simulate itself... It does come from the
                 mathematician Goedel - partly because he used TMs in his
                 famous theorem, I believe.
              2. Two, the new one and the old one. (hahahahah ???)
        How many dadaists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            To get to the other side.
        How many Democratic presidential candidates from 1988 did it take
            to screw in a light bulb?
              1. (Mike Dukakis) In Massachusetts, my enlightened
                 government has made it unnecessary for people to screw
                 in their own light bulbs, as we have put thousands of
                 former welfare recipients to work for the Dept. of Light
                 Bulb Installation. These employees will come to your
                 home or business and install any incandescent bulb, on
                 only a few months notice.
              2. (Bruce Babbitt) It's foolish to talk about screwing in
                 light bulbs when we haven't even taken the first step,
                 and that is to remove the old bulb. I challenge my
                 fellow candidates to stand up with me and help me remove
                 this old light bulb [stands, but nobody else does] Hah!
                 What wimps. You guys make Bush look like Rambo.
              3. (Richard Gephart) It doesn't matter whether the bulb is
                 changed or not; it only matters that the new bulb was
                 made in the US of A. Taiwan and South Korea have put up
                 massive barriers to importing US light bulbs; we'll see
                 how they like it when their bulbs cost $10,000 to screw
                 in here.
              4. (Gary Hart) This oblique reference to screwing is an
                 obvious attempt to drag my personal life into this
                 campaign. Frankly, I resent it, and the American people
                 resent it.
              5. (Al Gore) As usual, the other left-wing wacko candidates
                 are putting forth solutions that moderate Southerners
                 won't cotton to on Super Tuesday. At least I hope not.
              6. (Paul Simon) My media experts tell me I'm foolish for
                 wearing my hair the same way I did in the 50's. But
                 that's what Paul Simon's all about. And I suppose my
                 media experts are gonna say I'm foolish for this, but in
                 all candor, I change my light bulbs the same way I did
                 in the 50's: my wife gets on a ladder and I turn it.
              7. (Jesse Jackson) Changing the light bulb is a partial
                 solution at best. I'm more of a Lone Ranger than a light
                 bulb changer. But even the Lone Ranger had Tonto and
                 Silver, and the shameful fact is that the American
                 Indians of today don't have enough silver, or gold, or
                 even paper money to allow them to buy into the American
                 Dream or some extra light bulbs. We must ensure that all
                 Americans can light their homes, from the lighthouse to
                 the White House.
        How many Republican Presidential candidates from 1988 did it take
            to change a light bulb?
              1. (Dole) When I was a poor boy growing up in Kansas we
                 didn't have light bulbs. Now I have the housekeeper do
                 it.
              2. (DuPont) Light bulbs need to be changed? Gosh. I guess
                 the servants have always taken care of that... With a
                 DuPont administration, the power of the free market will
                 be unleashed to produce light bulbs that never need
                 changing.
              3. (Robertson) Oh, Lord, with thy divine illumination, heal
                 this light bulb!
              4. (Kemp) It's morning in America! Why should we worry
                 about light bulbs? Let those doom-crying Democrats worry
                 about light bulbs! [stumble over chair in the dark].
              5. (Haig) One. Snap to it, soldier!
              6. (Bush) None. (Bush in an earnest lap dog voice) I resent
                 that question. I've answered it before, and I think the
                 media are keeping this thing alive. I think the American
                 people are TIRED of light bulb jokes.
        How many Kennedy assassination conspiracy theorists does it take
            to screw in a light bulb?
            15-One to screw it in, five to say he acted alone, one to say
            that someone hidden in the ceiling helped, one to film it,
            one to do an intense examination of the film and conclude
            that a) it was tampered with and b) it proves that the first
            screwer did not act alone, one to insist that the bulb was
            altered after it was unscrewed, three tramps to walk across
            the room an hour later, one to insist LBJ really screwed the
            bulb in, and one to accuse all the others of being
            disinformation specialists.
        How many election canvassers does it take to change a light bulb?
            
            None. They'd just go round telling everyone that it's time
            for a change but the only way this can come about is if
            everyone votes for "New light bulb."
        How many Russians does it take to change a light bulb?
            That's a military secret.
        How many military information officers does it take to change a
            light bulb?
            At the present point in time it is against policy and the
            best interests of military strategy to divulge information of
            such a statistical nature. Next question, please.
        How many American Imperialist Pigs does it take to screw in a
            light bulb?
            Three - one to put in the bulb, and two to search through the
            cartons of inferior American produced light bulbs for one
            that isn't defective.
            Note: Probably the Eastern European equivalent of an ethnic
            joke.
        How many Sparts does it take to change a light bulb?
            You can't CHANGE a light bulb!
            Note: Sparts = Spartacus Youth League, a leftist fringe group
            that believes in violent revolution. Attributed to Michael
            Anderson '83, a student activist at Harvard.

            It's no use trying to CHANGE it, it's got to be SMASHED !!!

            One, but the bulb has to be changed constantly.
        How many anarchists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            All of them.
            Note: An anarchic society has no one in charge; each must do
            for theirself. Perhaps it would help to say, "All of them.
            Or, none of them. Or several." (BTW, I prefer "theirself" to
            any other construction.)
        How many British navy Officers does it take to change a light
            bulb?
            Only one, but it takes him seven weeks to get there.
        How many Chinamen does it take to change a light bulb?
            Thousands, because Confucious say many hands make light work.
        How many seventies disco dancers does it take to change a light
            bulb?
            Two. One to boogie up the ladder and one to say "Get
            daaowwwwn !"
        How many blacks does it take to change a light bulb?
            Three: One to boogie up the ladder, two to keep the beat.

            bulb?
            Four-one to rob the liquor store to get money for the bulb,
            one to drive the getaway car, one to screw it in, and one to
            hold his crack pipe while he does it.

            Well, he thinks it's five but as we all now it's only him,
            so...
        How many people with multiple personality disorder does it take
            to screw in a light bulb?
            One, but they're really three.
        How many manic-depressives does it take to change a light bulb?
            Only one, but they keep changing it back and forth between
            the new and old bulbs. (Yes, anal-retentive really does have
            a hyphen.)
        How many smokers does it take to change a light bulb?
            At least five. If they all light up together the light bulb
            will do so too.
        How many people in a Burger King advert does it take to change a
            light bulb?

            burger to a Burger King burger."
        How many archaeologists does does it take to change a light bulb?
            
            Three. One to change it and two to argue about how old the
            old one is.
        How many preservation society members does it take to screw in a
            light bulb?
            One, but it takes a year to find an antique Edison light bulb
            so it'll be architecturally accurate.
        How many "Changing light bulbs"-joke writers does it take to
            change a light bulb?
            Two hundred, and don't ask why because they haven't -figured
            that out yet.
        How many of me does it take to change a light bulb?
            Three. One to change it, one to make up a joke about it, and

            everyone.
        How many mutants does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            Two thirds.
            Note: Many mutations/birth defects result in people missing
            limbs, etc. Thus, a mutant is often only "2/3 of a person".
            Or, perhaps it's "Got three hands, only needs two for the
            job?"
        How many Contras does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Only one, but he doesn't know where it came from.
              2. One, but he needs one Iranian, one Israeli, four
                 Canadians, and Arab, twenty Swiss, and Afghan, and
                 Oliver North to help him.
        Note: Both answers are topical to the 1987 Iran/Contra hearings.
        How many social workers does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Four. One to remove the bulb from the socket and take it
                 away, without checking whether or not there was actually
                 anything wrong with it, one to accuse its owners of
                 mistreating it, one to find somewhere else to screw it
                 in for the next 6 months, and one to eventually bring it
                 back and say it was all done with the light bulb's best
                 interests at heart.
              2. Four. One to change the bulb, one to counsel the old
                 bulb because it's been thrown away by an uncaring
                 society, one to arrange the case conference and one to
                 make sure they are all following the correct working

            telling us the bulbs would never need to be replaced, Ted

        How many rec.humor.funny readers does it take to screw in a light
            bulb?
            50. They all stand out in the hall while Maddi comes out
            every once in a while and looks at all the light bulbs people
            have brought. Finally she selects a few. They're all quite
            feeble and burn out after a few minutes, so she comes out for
            more. But she selects more dim bulbs, which causes great
            discontent among the people who have brought really bright,
            long-lasting bulbs.
        How many rec.humour posters does it take to change a light bulb ?

              1. 100-one to announce that it burned out, 10 to agree, 20
                 to come running in with new light bulbs and screw them
                 in, 9 to screw them in and leave the old bulb in, 10 to
                 ask for a videotape of the screwing, another one to come
                 in a few minutes later and notice the bulb went out
                 again and start the whole process all over again. And
                 one (me!) to notice that this doesn't actually add up to
                 100.
              2. 1000. And they change the same bulb over and over and
                 over again and still no one notices it's been changed so
                 they change it again and again and then they even
                 discuss it and then someone flames them for not doing it
                 in rec.humor.d.
              3. 565. 1 to put in a trick bulb (say, a flash bulb), 6 to
                 flame the first, pointing out that this bulb is
                 different from the old one, 29 to counter-flame,
                 pointing out that the new bulb is deliberately
                 different, and is parodying the old one, 7 to leave the
                 room, citing the extreme density of the 6, 12 to demand
                 that this commentary be redirected to the other room, 14
                 to ask that the bulb be changed again, since they missed
                 seeing it the first time, and 496 (a bit excessive, but
                 it's not my joke) to climb all over each other, trying
                 to put the old bulb back in.
              4. An infinitely growing number : - One to announce that
                 the bulb burned out. Ten to agree. One to change it, one

                 in saying "Our news software hasn't been working and I
                 missed the original light bulb joke. Would someone
                 please post it again or email it to me?", one to post in
                 quoting everything so far and the words "Me too", two to
                 turn it into a cascade, another ten to build the cascade
                 into a disk-wasting monster, one to post in with "I
                 don't get it. Isn't this the place for FUNNY jokes?",
                 one to post in after two months "What's this light bulb
                 joke you're all talking about?", one to repost it a
                 month later thinking it's a new joke, one to post "I
                 didn't get it. What's the punchline?", one to post "Has
                 anyone got a list of these? I'm starting a list, so
                 please send me all your light bulb jokes", and one to
                 cross-post the joke to alt.fan.lightbulbs 6 months later
                 prefixed by "Are we allowed to tell jokes in here?" and
                 accompanied by all of our old favourites like "How many
                 programmers...? None that's a hardware problem.", three
                 to ask, a month later, "What FTP sites are the old light
                 bulbs archived at?", and any number to revive the entire
                 exchange at stochastic intervals of two to six months.
        How many alt.fan.pratchett readers does it take to change a light
            bulb?
            Four. One to actually change the bulb, one to write amusing
            footnotes about it, one to propose to Laura, and a newbie to
            ask if that's really THE Terry Or colette or both, and then
            to realise that the speed of light can't be measured, except
            in badgers, or possibly multiple of pi, then to say sod it
            and ask if anyone knows where to find the lyrics for the
            hedgehog song...

              1. Two. One to screw in the light bulb, and one to watch
                 him to make sure he doesn't say 'nipple'.
              2. Eight. One screws in the light bulb, but seven more do

              3. Eleven. One to ask to be on the light bulb gif mailing
                 list, nine to say "ME TOO!", and another to post a
                 message asking for the intructions on how to view a
                 light bulb.
                 Note: If you don't beleive me, see the

                 alt.binaries.pictures.celebreties, and alt.sex
                 newsgroups and you will see threads up to 10 "ME TOO!"s
                 long consisting of all AOL'ers requesting to be put on
                 non exisitent .gif/ftp mailing lists. Internet folklore
                 tells us that all the gits are on AOL. The software
                 they're using is only partly to blame.

            in saying "Yes, but they have herbal remedies for it
            nowadays", one to post "And homeopathic ones too, I read
            somewhere", one to post in saying he accidentally deleted the
            original light bulb joke and could someone please post it
            again or email it to him, one to post in quoting everything
            so far and the words "Me too", two to turn it into a cascade,
            one to post "What's this light bulb joke you're all talking
            about then?", one to post "I dunno, it sounds like some kind
            of food", one to post "In that case, has anyone got a recipe
            for one then?", one to post in requesting Michael Traub look
            up and tell us all its B12 content, one to post "Will it help
            cure my auntie's arthritis?", one to assert that it probably
            won't, but its effectiveness at this might well be increased
            by accompanying it with some shiatsu and meditation, two to
            condemn that as too unscientific, one to ask whether light
            bulbs are totally vegan, one to post "Read the FAQ", one
            assert that they are and add "I like light bulbs. They're low
            in fat, and stay crunchy in soya milk too !", one to announce
            that she's leaving the list unless the discussion gets a bit
            more meaningful, three to post in reassuring her that
            eventually it will, Lissa Mosley to post that the list
            moderators feel they must respectfully request that the
            discussion be moved to private email as it has been going on
            far too long, one to agree with this and add "So what has all
            this got to do with ethical veg*nism anyway?" and suggest the
            discussion be moved to alt.fan.lightbulbs , and one to post
            in quoting this suggestion and add "What's that?". So the
            discussion moves to usenet, as our intrepid vegan-l
            subscribers venture beyond the boundaries of email, and
            alt.fan.lightbulbs finds itself taking a few days off from
            the "My incredible light" and "Light Bulb death" discussions
            and come up with some new jokes...
        How many alt.sex.stories readers does it take to change a light
            bulb?
            Cindy fondled the burnt-out bulb whilst beads of sweat
            glistened on her perfectly rounded breast... Her brother
            Billy had gone to the hardware store to get a new light bulb.
            Suddenly the door opened and there he stood, silhouetted
            against the sharp light from the doorway. She could see the
            bulge in his pants.. "They didn't have any light bulbs but
            wait'll you get a load of my hardware", he said as he started
            unzipping his pants...
        How many uk.singles readers does it take to change a light bulb?
            Most of them. One female to notice that it had gone out and
            post something about how light bulbs are so masculine to the
            group, two to post in disagreeing with this, Susan Macran to
            post "Bog off stumpy!", a whole terminal room in Keele to sit
            there discussing it only among themselves, one to post a
            coherent critique of Susan Macran's last post, Kate Smith to
            complain that the women always get flamed more than the men,
            Menya to say that light bulbs are sexy as long as they're
            orange and could someone bring her a nice hot one, and two
            people to post in suggesting a boink so they can all get
            together and change the light bulb, with real friendship and
            good lighting not relationships uppermost in their minds.

                 family tradition regarding light bulbs is more justified
                 and ancient than anyone else's.
        How many IRC chatters does it take to change a light bulb?
            None. They're so busy saying hello, goodbye, and kicking each
            other off that noone ever has enough time to get anything
            done !
        How many humor theorists does it take to submit a light bulb
            joke?
            300 - one to change the bulb and 299 to analyze it to death.
        How many netters does it take to submit a light bulb joke?
              1. 1000 - One to invent the joke and 999 to submit "How
                 many programmers does it take to screw in a light bulb?
                 None, that's a hardware problem."
              2. 2, 1 to do it and 1 to read this huge file first to
                 check it hasn't been done already!
        How many light bulb jokes does it take to change a light bulb
            joke?
            Hmmmm - the probability that a given light bulb joke will be
            submitted to the net in any given week is .4, and the
            probability that it will have changed detectably since the
            last transmission is .2 . Hence (assuming independence, which
            is reasonable since no submitter of a light bulb joke ever
            seems to know it has been submitted before, within the last 2
            or 3 weeks), the probability that it will change in a given
            week is .08. So it takes about 12.5 light bulb jokes to
            change a light bulb joke.
        How many knock-knock jokes does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            
            Who's there?

            Note: refers to the Newton's poor handwriting recognition
            techniques.
        How many surrealists does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Two. One to hold the giraffe and the other to fill the
                 bathtub with brightly colored machine tools.
              2. Two. One to change it and one to throw a bucket of water
                 out the window. (An interesting story about this joke -
                 it was once being told at a party or something, and the
                 person being asked correctly made up a completely
                 irrelevant answer, and was promptly corrected by a loud
                 chorus of "No, it's a fish !")
        How many fish does it take to change a light bulb?
            surrealist.

            Four; one to throw bulbs against the wall, one to pile
            hundreds of them in a heap and spray-paint it orange, one to
            glue light bulbs to a cocker spaniel, and one to put a bulb
            in the socket and fill the room with light while all the
            critics and buyers are watching the fellow smashing the bulbs
            against the wall, the fellow with the spray-gun, and the
            cocker spaniel. (what goes clink-clink-clink, ow-woooo?)
        How many sado-masochists does it take to change a light bulb?
            Two. One to hold it and one to kick the chair out from under
            him.

            None. "And that's magic !"

        How many computer security experts does it take to change a light
            bulb?
            "That depends on the TCSEC rating of the object light bulb.
            If it's a C2 bulb (or below), one. If a B1 bulb, just one,
            but he/she must document the potential covert channel. If a
            B2 bulb, he/she must also audit the covert channel. If a
            B3/A1 bulb, none, since covert channels are not allowed. [See
            also the "Orange Book"]
        How many Systems Assurance testers does it take to change a light
            bulb?
            None. We just noticed the room was dark. We don't fix the
            problems, we just find them.
        How many SAS programmers does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. How many?
              2. It depends : - If they are applications programmers, it
                 takes exactly twice as many as are currently available.
                 If they are host programmers, it takes one for each
                 variant of Unix and/or MicroSoft Windows. If they are
                 core programmers, it only takes one. He just holds the
                 bulb to the socket and waits for the world to revolve
                 around him.
              3. One to analyze the historical failure rates of light
                 bulbs using PROC LIFEREG, so as to anticipate the
                 failure of the light bulb before the user actually has
                 to report it, one to explain why SAS is better for
                 changing light bulbs than S-Plus, SPSS/X, BMDP, SYSTAT,
                 MINITAB or a spreadsheet, one to write a custom
                 interface in AF/SCL allowing the user to manually
                 request the changing of the light bulb after its failure
                 (prematurely) occurs, one to write a report with PROC
                 SQL and PROC REPORT which will summarize the light bulbs
                 needing to be changed, sorted twelve different ways,
                 cross-indexed (by wattage, type, and
                 prematureness-of-failure) and totaled, one to actually
                 spin the light bulb into the socket using SAS/Insight,
                 one to call Cary to try to get them to explain when a
                 new version of the light bulb will ship, how much we'll
                 pay to keep using light bulbs for another year, and what
                 we'll do if our site sends all its light bulbs to Europe
                 where 120V/60Hz light bulbs tend to explode upon
                 insertion in 220V/50Hz circuits, one to write an
                 incomprehensible ten line SAS macro program which will
                 perpetually insert new filaments into all mission
                 critical light bulbs until its author is fired, at which
                 point the SAS macro will automatically encode itself
                 into a copy of the latest SAS/ETS usage notes, one to
                 write a graphical front end to the light bulb changing
                 process using SAS/EIS, with little speedometers showing
                 the number of light bulbs changed per hour, so that
                 management can understand why we need to buy bigger
                 light bulbs, one to prepare a SUGI paper summarizing the
                 entire light bulb project, taking credit for the design
                 and execution of the light bulb project itself as well
                 as the invention of the light bulb itself, another one
                 to prepare a second SUGI paper benchmarking light bulb
                 replacement on twelve different types of light sockets,
                 with separate graphs for florescent and incandescent
                 bulbs (made with SAS/Graph, except for the titling,
                 axes, color, polylines, and background, which were all
                 added manually with Cricket Graph on a Mac), ten to push
                 the dollie loaded with SAS/Light Bulb manuals, and, One
                 more to ask SAS-L for help when you really need to
                 change that bulb, now.
              4. Zero. We have the housekeeping staff do it for us.
              5. Please let us know!
              6. That depends; what color is the bulb?
              7. It all depends on whether they can read the manuals or
                 not. That needs to be in there somewhere as a qualifier!
              8. They can't change light bulbs... Without light, they
                 can't read the manual, and without the manual, they
                 can't figure out how to change the light bulb.
              9. This can not be computed. Changing light bulbs is a
                 hardware problem...
             10. Two. One to change the light bulb and one to make sure
                 the stack of manuals doesn't tip over.
             11. One, once the documentation for the procedure is found
                 in one of the 15 manuals on the shelf.
             12. Well, it depends upon the platform on which one stands!
             13. Actually none, if you are willing to close your eyes to
                 the (validity of the) output.
             14. It can't be done yet. "Light bulb" is more than 8
                 characters long.
        How many APL hackers does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            None. There's a primitive for that.
            Note: I don't do APL but I think a primitive is a procedure
            that is included as a part of the language. You don't have to
            write code ("hack") to do it.
        How many Technical Support staff does it take to change a light
            bulb?
              1. "Well, we have an exact copy of your light bulb here and
                 it seems to be working OK. Can you be more specific
                 about the exact problem?..."
              2. I'm sorry, we don't support that kind of lighting
                 technology.
              3. Our engineers are busy at the moment... We have assigned
                 query number 987632 to your question. Please refer to it
                 in all future correspondence.

            light bulb?
            We have an exact copy of the light bulb here, and it seems to
            be working fine. Can you tell me what kind of system you
            have? Ok. Now, exactly how dark is it? Ok, there could be
            four or five things wrong . . . have you tried the light
            switch?
        How many MIS guys does it take to change a light bulb?

            will be contacted.
        How many first-time computer users does it take to screw in a
            light bulb?

            on.
        How many experienced computer users does it take to change a
            light bulb?
            Dammit, why do they have to keep changing it ? Every bloody
            week. You'd've thought they'd have learnt by now, if it's not
            broken they shouldn't bugger about with it. What's that ? It
            WAS broken this time you say ? Blush
        How many televangelists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            None. They screw in hotel rooms.
        How many of Jed's followers does it take to screw in a light

            bulbs.
        How many gas fitters does it take to change a light bulb?
            Three: One to turn up the day before when you're out, one to

            bulb.
        How many builders does it take to change a light bulb?
            One, but I'll 'ave to take out yer rafters and 'ave a go at

            round some numbers.

            That's a blow !
        How many rednecks does it take to screw in a light bulb?
              1. Six. They all beat the hell out of it, leave it lying in
                 a dark alley and brag about it in the pub afterwards.
              2. One, it only takes one person to use a hammer.
              3. Three, one to change the bulb, one to take care of the
                 sheep, and one to observe and try to think why he isn't
                 tending to the sheep's needs.
              4. Two, one to drive their home to the hardware store and

                 sticky back plastic.
        How many people on Get Stuffed does it take to change a light
            bulb?
            Four. Two to trot merrily down to the shops to buy a new one,
            of whom person 1 then rips it unceremoniously out of its
            packaging and person 2 starts to do the changing, and the 2
            "Mystery Chefs" to interrupt and tell us he's doing it all
            wrong.

        How many Jocks (disk jockeys) does it take to screw in a light
            bulb?
            None. That's a tech job.
            Note: That joke is a lot funnier if you know a little bit
            about the wonderful world of commercial radio. Suffice it to
            say that it is a highly unionized environment, and there is
            always a little friendly (?) bickering between the
            technicians and the jocks. :-)
        How many Radio 1 DJs does it take to change a light bulb?

            light bulb?
            Welsh Choir: No, but you sing it and we'll hum the tune in
            moving harmony...
        How many crusties does it take to change a light bulb?
            Twelve. Crusty #1 yanks the old bulb out and crusty #2 is
            just about to put the new one in when crusties #3 and #4
            stagger in and start arguing that it's their turn. In the
            ensuing squabble the bulb gets dropped on the floor and
            smashes. Then crusty #5 points out what a good laugh this is
            and so chief crusty (#6) dispatches crusties #7 and #8 to go
            down the shops to buy a new one. After having visited at
            least 2 off licences on the way, they find their way into the
            hardware shop. While crusty #7 is busily trying to buy 6 new
            bulbs for the princely sum of 10p each and a can of special
            brew, crusty #8 is busy liberating as many as will fit into
            his long grey shapeless overcoat's pockets. They are joined
            on the way back by crusties #9 and #10 whose names they've
            forgotten but they do at least sound familiar, and much
            frivolous hugging ensues until someone remembers what the
            trip down the shops was all about. On their way back into the
            squat they pass crusty #11, who has only just joined the
            group, and who is just on his way out to go and get his hair
            crimped. Anyway once inside, the light bulbs are all smashed
            on the floor and the stereo is cranked up so the dancing can
            begin. At this point crusty #12 comes back in from a
            Levellers gig and collapses in a corner, only to find he is
            lying on something that makes a noise, which turns out to be
            the dog, holding the last unsmashed light bulb in its mouth.
        How many shaggy dogs does it take to screw in a light bulb?

            Note: Could someone please tell me if this is referring to
            anything...

            revolve around him.
        How many health food freaks does it take to change a light bulb?
            Two. One to remove the old one, and one to check the

            health or philosophical reasons?)
        How many vegans does it take to change a light bulb?
            Two. One to change it and one to get out a copy of The
            Ethical Consumer (or similar) and discover to his/her horror
            that the manufacturer (Thorn Lighting) is part of Thorn EMI
            who are involved in (blah blah blah...)
        How many people at a London Vegans meeting does it take to change

              1. Four hundred to attempt to seize the old bulb and then
                 surround the house when it rebuffs them.
              2. It doesn't matter, they just burn down the house.
        Note: BATF is The US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms,
            repsonsible for setting up that Waco (We Aint Coming Out !)
            Branch Davidians siege in spring 1993, which ended in a
            fashion the second punchline suggests.
        How many xxxxxxx (fill in the blank: FBI agents, narcs, deans)
            does it take to screw in a light bulb?

            very still, because they KNOW the world turns.

        How many Hegelians does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            Two, of course. One stands at one end of the room and argues
            that it isn't dark; the other stands across from him and says
            that true light is impossible. This dialectic creates a
            synthesis when the bulb gets screwed in.
            Note: Hegel and Marx use a logical procedure called
            dialectics to seek answers to seemingly mutual exclusive
            positions. Shortened it is "thesis, antithesis, synthesis".
            Thus 'no light' and 'no dark' can arrive at a middle ground
            through logical examination 'it's dark but it can be made
            light'.
        How many Platonists does it take to screw in a light bulb?

        How many deconstructionists does it take to screw in a light
            bulb?
              1. It doesn't matter. Even if the bulb is screwed in, it
                 will always be flickering, however faintly, so it really
                 hasn't worked. It is incapable of delivering
                 uninterrupted light.
              2. You have to examine the nature of the question.
        How many chickens does it take to screw in a light bulb?

            the story about "last night."
            Note: This is guaranteed true by someone who used to work
            there. The stories refer to wild copious drinking and also a
            few bedroom exploits.

        How many gun control advocates does it take to screw in a light
            bulb?
              1. Let the police do it - private citizens can't be trusted
                 with light bulbs !
              2. They don't do that; they pass laws against burned-out
                 bulbs, and then they wonder why it's still so dark.
                 Meanwhile, a lot of people get hurt because they can't
                 see.

                 "I'm the NRA" ad while doing so, and one to complain
                 about the waiting period.
              2. Two, one to do it and the other one to get his dick out
                 of the gun.
        How many Newfies does it take to change a light bulb?
            Two. One to bite the bulb out of the socket and one to hammer

            Ten-four to talk about how great it is that they've all come
            together to do this, one to screw it in, one to film it for
            the news, one to plan a marketing strategy based on it, one
            to reminisce about mass naked bulb screwings in the '60s, one
            to watch reruns of '50s TV shows, and one to play classic
            rock.
        How many (generation) Xers does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            
            Two, one to go and shoplift the bulb so the boomers have
            something to screw in and the other to screw it in for
            minimum wage.
        How many vampires does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            None, they like it in the dark.
        How many one-armed people does it take to change a light bulb?
            Only one, as long as he kept the till receipt.
        How many does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            Two, but they have to be really tiny.
        How many CND supporters does it take to change a light bulb?
            None. They won't, because:
               o "I'm not about to touch anything that has WATT written
                 on it!"
               o "If we change our bulb, they will just change theirs to
                 a brighter one, so where will it all end?"
               o "We already have enough bulbs to illuminate the entire
                 world three times over."
               o "We shouldn't spend money for light bulbs as long as
                 anyone is hungry anywhere."
               o "We don't know what effect all this artificial light
                 will have on the future of mankind."
               o "Nature provides us with all the light we need; we just
                 haven't learned to husband it yet."
               o "Artificial light isn't aesthetically correct."
               o "The candle is more traditional, and it uses no
                 electricity."
               o "It is the responsibility of the Federal Government to
                 provide light to all Americans, without regard to race,
                 age, creed, color sex (anatomic), sex (persuasion),
                 religion, socio-economic status, national origin, or
                 need."
        How many furries does it take to change a light bulb?
            Four. One to climb up the ladder and change the light bulb.
            Three to protect the first with overkill-type weaponry, wear
            clothing which emphasizes curves and musculature, and look
            cute and dangerous at the same time.
            Note: furries = characters in what's called "furry" science
            fiction. Best depicted on cover art; the men look like
            bodybuilders, the women are indescribably buxom, and both
            wear some version of Tarzan/Jane-style costumes to show as
            much skin and musculature as possible.
        How many furfen does it take to change a light bulb?
            Three. One to climb up the ladder and change the light bulb.
            One to complain that there was too much erotica in the
            previous answer and this one, and that people should come up
            with more non-erotic answers because of the impact on public
            negativity towards furriness. And the third to explain about
            their erotic dreams involving furry light bulb jokes.
            Note: furfen = fans of furries. "fen" is a long-used plural
            for "fan".
        How many editors of Poor Richard's Almanac does it take to
            replace a light bulb?
            Many hands make light work.
            Note: "Poor Richard's Almanac" is a classic of colonial
            Americana, written (pseudonymously) by Ben Franklin in the
            1740s. It advocates a simple, thrifty lifestyle in the form
            of aphorisms, including that one, so it makes a nice play on
            words.
        How many big black monoliths does it take to change a light bulb?
            
            Sorry, light bulbs are an evolutionary dead end.
            Note: It might be something to do with the film - 2001 Space
            Odyssey. It's more the book, actually. That and "The Lost
            Worlds of 2001" should help illuminate this one. The big
            black monoliths, according to the books, are meant to help
            man evolve, something sort of hinted at in the film but more
            explicitly stated in the books.
        How many light bulbs does it take to change a light bulb?
            One, if it knows its own Goedel number.
            (Could somebody please explain this one to me ! I think it's
            something to do with the maths/logic theories of Kurt Goedel,
            about it being impossible to prove things.)
        How many Bayesians/subjectivists does it take to screw in a light
            bulb?
            As many as you think it takes.
            P.S. Fortunately, the author has learned much about Bayesian
            inference (and about the subjectivity inherent in "classical"
            inference) since then -- so spare us the flames about the
            misperceptions on which the above joke is based.
        How many dadaists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            To get to the other side.
            Note: The "dadaist" answer, like dadaism itself, goes further
            than the surrealist one. Whereas the surrealist one at least
            bears the semblance of a relationship to the question, the
            dadaist one is the punchline to another joke entirely.
        How many spies does it take to change a light bulb?
            Why bother?
            (I guess the point is that spies like to do everything in the
            dark anyway?)
        How many EST followers does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            A roomful. They take turns as the leader tells them what
            rotten and worthless bulb screwers they are. No one is
            allowed to leave the room to go to the bathroom while the
            bulb screwing is in progress.
            Note: EST (Erhard Seminars Training) was some sort of
            self-esteem-building programme that was popular in the late
            1970s. The sessions were as described in the punchline.
        How many Amish does it take to screw in a light bulb?
              1. Two, one to hold the bulb and the other to tell him it's
                 against the will of God.
              2. Amish don't have light bulbs. They bake pies.
        Note: The Amish are a people, also known as the "Pennsylvania
            Dutch", who mostly (though not exclusively) live in
            southeastern Pennsylvania and are noted for their religion.
            They adhere to a strict code of living that forbids using
            such modern conveniences as electricity and automobiles, and
            indeed often look and act as if they were time travelers from
            the early nineteenth century (they drive around in horse and
            buggy carts). They are descended from German Protestant
            immigrants of that time (hence the "Dutch" as the immigration
            people misunderstood "Deutsch", the answer they gave for
            nationality). Their quaint lifestyle draws many people to SE
            PA every year, where they often have a chance to sample their
            sweet pies and cakes. Hence the joke.
        How many NSC members does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. We can't say.
              2. Three, in fourteen countries.
        Note: The NSC is the US National Security Council, whose rubric
            Oliver North was acting under, and which is often accused by
            people such as Gore Vidal of secretly governing the country.
        How many Dune Coons does it take to replace a light bulb?
            Three - one to hold the bulb and two to turn the stool, but
            they need a foreign adviser to tell them it was burned out.
            Note: I presume a "Dune Coon" means a 3rd world peasant.
        How many supply-siders does it take to change a light bulb?
            None. The darkness will cause the light bulb to change by
            itself.
            Note: "Supply-siders" were the force behind Reagan's early
            reforms, and their economic theories were just like those of
            Thatcher (only the Thatcherites were more extreme). They
            believed that if they shifted the focus of government
            economic policy to stimulating supply rather than demand, the
            business cycle would be stopped at an agreeable point and
            inflation would be permanently whipped. Obviously, it didn't
            quite work out that way.
        How many Ann Arborites does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            None, they just start a "Coping With Darkness" support group.
            Note: Ann Arbor is a where, not a who. It's the home of the
            University of Michigan, which has a fairly liberal
            reputation.
        How many Lacanians does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            Three-one to do it, one to desire it, and the ignorant Other.
            Note: Jacques Lacan (1901-82) was a prominent French
            psychoanalyst and theorist who is very influential with
            literary critics at the moment. This relates to his theories.
        How many gypsies does it take to change a light bulb?
            None, but you lose a lot of light bulbs.
            Note: None because gypsies don't have mains electricity, and
            the losing is a play on the larcenous reputation of Gypsies.
            You give a Gypsy a light bulb and ask him to change the
            hallway lamp, pretty soon you have one less light bulb and
            the hallway lamp is still out.
        How many Helmsley employees does it take to change a light bulb?
            100: 99 to try, and one to fire them all.
            Note: Leona Helmsley is the owner of a (New York?) hotel who
            was a real bitch to work for. She fired employees at little
            or no provocation.
        How many marginals does it take to change a light bulb?
            Two: One to screw it in real good, and one to call the
            proctologist.
            Note: Anyone know what a marginal is or does? It sounds like
            a rude reference to a supposed homosexual practice of putting
            foreign objects in each others' rectums. Perhaps "marginal"
            is some regional insulting term for some kind of male
            homosexual?
        How many Martians does it take to screw in a light bulb?
            One and a half. (Is this a science-fiction in-joke?)
        Why did the light bulb fall out of the tree?
              1. Cos it was doing an impersonation of the sun, setting.
              2. Cos Christmas tree decorations are always cheap and
                 nasty.
              3. Cos it was autumn. (eh?)
        (Thus combining the twin themes of light bulb jokes and jokes
            about things falling out of trees...)
        How many Tauruses does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. None: Tauruses don't like to change anything.
              2. One. But only if they can celebrate afterwards with a
                 ten course meal and some great sex.
              3. One, but just try to convince them that the burnt out
                 bulb is useless and should be thrown away.
        How many Geminis does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Two (of course) but it will take all week, and when
                 they're done the light bulb will do your homework, speak
                 French, and shine any color you want it to.
              2. Two. Plus a portable phone, an Internet link and a copy
                 of the 'Bluffer's Guide to Changing Light Bulbs.'
              3. Two, but they never change it - they just keep arguing
                 about who is supposed to do it and how it's supposed to
                 be done.
        How many Cancerians does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Just one. But it takes a therapist three years to help
                 them through the grief process.
              2. Just one, and they'll use a non-disposable diaper too!
              3. None: Cancerians would worry themselves to death with
                 the problem.
        How many Leos does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Leos don't change light bulbs, although sometimes their
                 agents get a Virgo in to do it for them while they're
                 out.
              2. None: Leos are so enthusiastic they carry their own
                 light.
        How many Virgos does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Virgos don't have time to change their own light bulbs.
                 They're too busy changing them for everyone else.
              2. Approximately 1.000000 with an error of +/- 1 millionth.
              3. Let's see: One to spot the bulb, one to record the time
                 the bulb burned out and the date it was bought, one to
                 decide who's fault it is the bulb burned out and ask why
                 that brand was chosen in the first place, ten to decide
                 to remodel the house as long as they're changing the
                 bulb...
        How many Libras does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Er, two. Or maybe one. No - on second thoughts, make
                 that two. Is that okay with you?
              2. Why change the bulb? Isn't it more romantic in the dark?
              3. Well gee, I don't know really. I guess it depends on the
                 bulb and where it burned out. It might perhaps take just
                 one if it's just an ordinary bulb, but maybe two if the
                 person doesn't know where to find a new light bulb,
                 or...
        How many Scorpios does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Why do you want to know? Are you a cop?
              2. None - they'd rather sit in the dark.
              3. That information is strictly secret and only shared with
                 the inner members of the heirarchical Order.
        How many Sagittarians does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Look, ask me when I get back from India, okay?
              2. The sun is shining, the day is young, we've got our
                 whole lives ahead of us, and you're inside worrying
                 about a stupid burned out light bulb?
              3. A whole bunch: I can only keep them in the room long
                 enough for them to give the bulb a quarter turn a piece.
        How many Capricorns does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. None. Capricorns can't afford new light bulbs - unless
                 they're a legitimate business expense.
              2. I don't waste my time with these childish jokes.
              3. None: Why should I bother? It's probably just going to
                 burn out again tomorrow anyway.
        How many Aquarians does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Well, you have to remember that everything is energy
                 so...
              2. A hundred, but they'll all be competing to be the one to
                 change the bulb and bring light to the world.
              3. Like, why don't you just get out of my face and stop
                 asking me to do all your work for you? I'm, like, really
                 totally sick and tired of you asking me questions.
        How many Pisceans does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. Huh? The light's out?
              2. What light bulb?
              3. None: They concern themselves with inner light.
        How many Arians does it take to change a light bulb?
              1. None: Arians aren't afraid of the dark.
              2. Just the one. You want to make something of it, eh?
              3. Only one, but it takes a lot of light bulbs. (smash)
