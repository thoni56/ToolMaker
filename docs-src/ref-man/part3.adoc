ScannerMaker is a tool which provides a simple and yet powerful way of creating fast and robust scanners.

The main features of ScannerMaker are:

* Multiple vocabularies.
* Multiple scanners.
* Dynamic token size.
* Creates very fast scanners.
* User defined semantic actions associated with tokens.
* Generate scanners for different character sets.
* Generated scanners are able to handle nested levels of input, e.g. include files in programming languages.
* Integrated with other parts of ToolMaker.
* Various packing schemes to optimize for speed or space.

The reader must have a fairly well grounded knowledge in the area of scanners to take full advantage of this document.
The concept of regular expressions, semantic actions, and tokens should be well understood before reading this manual.
